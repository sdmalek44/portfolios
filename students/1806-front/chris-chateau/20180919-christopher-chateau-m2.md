# Chris Chateau - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for Mod 2 was to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals (e.g. array prototypes, scope, 'this' and 
recursion).  I also aimed to develop a basic understanding of React and create a fun, engaging game with the 'Game-Time' project.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Although Mod 2 was extremely challenging, I leave as a significantly stronger and more well-rounded developer. I loved the game-time project and its hands-on/visual nature. I enjoyed all of the positive feedback I received from friends and family. My partner Jessica and I were very proud to win first place in our student code fair. With that said, the Complete-Me project was very difficult for me. Working only in the terminal manipulating data was a new experience and something I'm still getting comfortable doing. Mod 2 pushed me, and I feel accomplished to be graduating to Mod 3.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Complete-Me

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

I received positive feedback in my Complete-Me evaluation which involved white-boarding the process of creating a prefix trie as well as deleting the 'suggestion' method from my code and re-writing & explaining it. White-boarding in an evaluation was a new experience for me and I learned a lot.

## C: Group Work & Projects
