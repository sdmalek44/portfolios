# Dina Caraballo - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to strengthen my problem solving skills and practice using the tools that I gained in module 1. Though, I still want to improve my problem solving skills and I want to continue to practice using the tools in a more efficient way, I feel good about my progress during this module. I feel ready to proceed into module 3.

## A: End of Module Assessment

According to instructors, I passed all end of module assessments.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module, we were assigned one individual project.

### Projects
* Complete-Me
-----------------------

#### Complete-Me

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/complete-me
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html

For this project, we were required to build a prefix tree/auto-complete feature.

## Student: Dina
## Evaluator: Nathaniel
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Everything looks good.
- Good job on whiteboarding.
- Get more comfortable explaining your code.

-----------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module, we were assigned two paired projects.

#### Game Time - Paired with Freddie Levenson

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/game-time
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

For this project, we were required to re-create the classic game, Tron, using OOP.

## Functional Expectations
Make the following fixes to receive a 4 for functionality:
* fix the bug for the orange path when the game is over and the canvas clears
* test the game class with the it blocks we wrote out
* rename the blocks to players
* refactor that if/else statement in the `handleKeyPress`

-----------------------

#### Weathrly - Paired with Cole Hart

* https://github.com/colehart/weathrly
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html

For this project, we were required to build a weather application that was fully functional and fetched data from an API.

## Student: Cole Hart & Dina Caraballo
## Evaluator: Brittany Storoz
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Responsiveness needs work
* Fix the bug that prevents updating the weather cards

-----------------------

## D: Professional Skills
During mod 2, we were required to attend several professional development sessions designed to prepare us for working as software developers; help us to begin developing our own narrative for job-hunting; aid us in giving and receiving feedback; and, provide us with project management tools.

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, I was one of the Student Advisory Board representatives for our cohort. I attended weekly meetings and served as a representative of my cohort in order to improve the culture and community at Turing. In addition, I was responsible for running our cohort retros (along with my fellow SAB rep) and taking our concerns back to the SAB in order to have them voiced and possibly effect positive change. Because of this responsibility, I also felt the need to check in with several students who appeared to be struggling with acclimating to Turing.

------------------

# Self-Reflection Rubric

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.


## D: Professional Development

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.


## E: Community Participation

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
They build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
