# Ben Hayek - FE 1806 Mod2 Portfolio
 ## Areas of Emphasis
 This module i set out to to improve my problem solving skills while gaining an understanding of scope, array prototypes, and react. It is hard to believe how much i feel I've learned in the short time ive spent at Turing, specifically in Mod2. Coming into this mod i felt i had to improve my time boxing and not spend all my time working on weekly projects. What i learned is when you devote specific time frames to specific items of focus you can retain much more information. Another area of focus for me was to help out students in the lower Mod. I made an effort to walk into their classroom and ask how things were going for them, or if they had any questions. I also walked through mythical creatures with the at lunch. I found that when people in the upper mods would walk up to me and ask if i needed help it helped me start a relationship with them and i wanted to do the same.

 For our individual project this mod we were assigned Complete-Me. This project revolved around understanding and building a functional trie that could take in new words as well as give suggestions based on what you typed in. After testing my Trie using mock data i injected an entire dictionary and was able to watch it build the Trie in real time in my terminal. This was one of the most difficult projects i have ever had to solve. It was hard to wrap my head around the concept and felt like it was not a lot of time to complete it before the due-date. Once we used the code in our Weathrly assignment and saw it worked it made it all worth it.

 ### Projects
 
 #### Game-Time
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

 This was one of my favorite projects at Turing. Although it was a little weird working with canvas, game-time allowed me to get a general grasp on OOP principles. It is also nice to have something fun and interactive in my portfolio that anyone can play. This was also a good inro to testing using Mocha.

 ## Evaluation
 Game Time
Students: Ben & Tobin
Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
Comments:
 Good, clean UI to start. Some directions would be nice for people have not played Frogger before (i.e. The goal is to make it to the other side ive times, into one of the alcoves... That the second portion you should be jumping onto the moving blocks and avoiding the "water", etc.)
Functional Expectations
3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface
2.75 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.
ESLint shows 3 errors
You can remove the tests for DOM interactions
JavaScript Style & OOP
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.
Workflow
3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
Good amount of commits
Majority of commits following conventions around good commit messages and do a good job describing what is included in the particular commit. Be sure to take advantage of using the body of a commit message for additional info about a commit
Would like to see more issues - both open and resolved

 #### Weathrly
 [Github URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/Weathrly)
[Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

 Weatherly has been in my opinion the single best learning experience while working on a project. When first looking at the specs Weathrly was very intimidating, but upon digging into it i learned so much. I now have a general undertanding of how react works and how to use state and props to pass data. This was also a good introduction to testing with React. Learning to work with API's and mock data was a fun and exciting experience especially when digging into the data in order to retrieve what information we wanted. I feel confident going forward in building apps with React and am excited to create more apps using this framework.

 ### Playing a Part
 
At my time at Turing i believe i have made connections that will help me to continue my career. I have used the resources given to me to answer questions i had and continue to make my mark in the community. I wish i would've attended more outside functions, but it was difficult with the full plate of work given to us. In the future i would like to branch out further and plan on attending the job fair in Denver next week. This Mod I was able to reach out to the lower Mod and help them with their assignments which helped me to better explain things and talk through code. It was also helpful to look at other peoples code bases and understand what they were trying to achieve.
