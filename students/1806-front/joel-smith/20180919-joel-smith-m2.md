## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Overall I was happy with my solo project. However, I wish I had taken the time to complete the React Static Comp, and I think 
it would have done me a lot of good. 

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JoelSmith123/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

My CompleteMe project consists of a node binary trie which is populated with dictionary words and stores them for efficient
retrieval.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I think the projects I paired on this year were an overall success. I want to continue to ensure with my partner that I'm 
contributing fairly to our projects, and I want to practice communicating openly with teammates. 

#### Game Time (Tron)

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in group discussions of projects we were working on as a class and took part in Turing events. However, I think 
I could do a lot better. I didn't pair with or help other students as much as I could have, and community participation is 
something I want to be a lot better at.
