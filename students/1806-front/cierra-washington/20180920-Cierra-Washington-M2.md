# (Cierra Washington) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

#### (What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

In this module I set out to become more confident as a problem solver, which I think I was able to accomplish. As we learned more about array prototypes, I also set out to become better at understanding those, which I think I was able to do. I feel quite confident with array prototypes.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.1/4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3/4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.2/4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.2/4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4/4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

I believe that I passed the end of module assessment. I do think that my proctor labeled me thinking through certain problems as "struggling", but I didn't feel like I was struggling at all. It's possible that I just wasn't moving fast enough under pressure, which is an issue that can be fixed with more practice/exposure to the interview style/situation.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual project for the mod was CompleteMe, which was an interesting learning experience.

# Game Time
* Students: Cierra & Derek
* Evaluator: Brittany


Comments:
* Many opportunities for refactoring, removing dead or unused code, and making long if/else conditions a bit more readable
* Some instances where methods and properties are on the wrong classes and should be moved to a more appropriate place
* Seemed to have a difficult pairing with working styles/collaborating on solving problems
* Worked really hard to get changes in over the weekend

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* Scores on the DOM aren't in the best spot, and text is tiny in comparison to the rest of the game

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

* Not sure what kind of github issues you were having, but in general we need to have more commits than we do. Commit smaller changesets more frequently rather than doing a ton of work all at once before committing it. This will help ensure that you don't lose a ton of work if something goes wrong, and will allow you to more easily rollback your repo to a previous state.


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

#### (ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I joined choir and participated in various community events. I also paired with students to help them with projects (which also helped me as a result).

------------------

#### (Weathrly)

* [Github](https://github.com/cierrajw/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weathrly was a really fun project to work on. I was excited to learn about React, and that learning process was fun. Learning how to test in React was tricky but I do feel more confient in doing that after the Weathrly project. The Weathrly project actually made me more confient with testing overall.
