# (James Burbage) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Some of the goals I set for myself was to pass the mod, and dedicate more time to projects and studying.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment

FAILED


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Complete Me)

Autocomplete features are a very common convention for text inputs on search fields. In this project you are going to be building a low level version of an auto complete system in JavaScript. The first thing your trie should be able to do is take in a word. It should also keep a count of how many words have been inserted. Once the words are placed into the trie it should be able to offer some suggestions based on a word prefix. You will need to write a method called suggest that will take in a word prefix and return an array of words that match the desired prefix. Our Trie won’t be very useful without a good dataset to populate it. Our computers ship with a special file containing a list of standard dictionary words. Our next objective is to load the dictionary into our trie. It should have a method called populate that will take in the desired data set and inject it into our trie. Next week you will create a Weather App that needs an autocomplete feature. Package your complete-me trie in a node module so that you can import it into future projects.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/james-burbage/frogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Learn object oriented programming (OOP) principles by building a game that is playable in the browser. Rank your top three game choices and submit them to instructors by starting a direct message that includes both project partners and all module instructors. (Game requests sent to only one instructor, or missing the project partner, do not count.) Instructors will try to assign you a game in your top three choices, but may suggest a different one based on how many students choose a particular game and difficulty levels. We want your game to be as full-featured as possible. Make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

- Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
- Allow the user to start a new game
- Display a score (if applicable)
- Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself (this might include instructions on how to play, a high score saved in localStorage, etc. Think of what would be most intuitive for your particular game.)
- Include multiple levels of difficulty

#### (Weathrly)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all).

As web developers you’re going to be living in the context of the web. With this next project you will be interacting with a web-api. Ultimately this is going to be a preview for what the real world is going to look like for most of you. Data is important and thats what the API provides. As a web-developer you will be giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for your user base.

In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried to assist with mod 1 in their studies by having multiple pairs with 4 different students.
