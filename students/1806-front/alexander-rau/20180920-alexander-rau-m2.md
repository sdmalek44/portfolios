# (Alexander Rau) - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had set out to build upon the foundations I had learned in Mod 1.  Ultimately, I wanted to be able to take and handle anything that was thrown at me, and this Mod really put me through it.  At the end, looking back, I have grown mightily as a developer, and I have gotten a lot out of the skills I was able to learn.  I drilled the concepts that were difficult for me with classmates that were having the same troubles, and it really paid off.  I definintely feel comfortable with the aspects of Front End web development that are not as front-facing (i.e. creating and diving into complex data structures).  I also got intense practice and reps whiteboarding and talking out code logic for complicated problems, which I believe will be invaluable for me going forward.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here is an overview of the single solo project I completed this Mod: Complete Me:


#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This project was by far the biggest challenge, for me, this Mod.  In this project, I had to build a functioning Prefix Trie to serve as an autocomplete program for a search input.  This meant it had to be able to break down words into letter chains, with leaves branching off when one word shares the same beginning letters as another.  This involved a ton of practice whiteboarding the concepts with classmates.  I initially tried to dive into this on my own and, after 3 days of: "attempt, get stuck, trash my code, repeat", I had to get with a group of my classmates who were stuck where I was.  We diagramed it out and built it step-by-step.  Ultimately, it was incredibly frustrating, but also rewarding.  I got a lot out of the whiteboarding and discussion experience, which definitely came in handy in the Weatherly project later in the Mod.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here is an overview of the partner projects I completed this Mod, including: Game Time and Weatherly:


#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project involved building a classic arcade game (for my group, specifically, we were assigned Snake) using the HTML Canvas.  This project helped me get well aquainted with ES6 Classes, and how parent classes pass down information to their children.  In order for everything to work on the canvas correctly, we had to make sure everything JavaScript drew was aware of it's position, as well as the position of everything else.  It was very challenging, and really put me through my paces in passing information from function to function.  I always had to ask myself: "What does this function need to work correctly?", and: "How do I get it the information it needs?"


Evaluation Comments: 

- Easy to follow directions - clean UI. Possibly add notification that game is speeding up each time snake has eaten 5 blocks of food. Game is really slow to start - possible for first level to be a bit faster? Maybe new iterations/levels could involve speeding up snake but also adding obstacles?

- Nice job articulating your code and speaking to inheritance.

Evaluation Score: Pass (we were given an extension to write more tests)

Feedback to me (from my partner) - Ashton and I had a very healthy and productive working relationship, and we were able to accomplish all of the goals we had set out to do for this project.  


#### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/weatherly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This project was a baptism into the world of React.  We had to build a weather app that queried a weather API, and displayed different cards with weather information for: the weather of the Current Day and time, the weather for the next 7 hours and the weather for the next 10 days.  I was able to take my knowledge of parent classes passing traits down to their children (from the Game Time project), and apply it here, as this is primarily how React elements communicate with each other.  I also got a lot of use from the whiteboarding skills we exercised in the Complete Me project, as my partner and I whiteboarded the overall page/card layout of the app, as well as how we were going to import and implement the Complete Me Trie.  As I revealed in the previous sentence, another part of this project was turning the preceeding Complete Me project into an NPM package and importing it to be used in the Search fields here.  That took some doing, and I learned a lot about that process.  This project also introduced me to testing with Jest and Enzyme, and I got to build out mock information for the testing suite to use.  For this project, I attempted to write as many tests as possible, and I got to fix the too few tests issue we had with Game Time.  This helped to always make sure the Weatherly components were functioning as they should, even when we added new functionality.


Evaluation Comments: N/A (none written)

Evaluation Score: Pass

Feedback to me (from my partner) - Derek and I had a post-project conversation.  We also had a very productive working relationship.  Even though we were not able to finish the complete functionality of importing in the Complete Me Trie (we had a bug that Nathaniel helped us solve during the eval), we had all other functionality working well and were able to get a lot done.


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this Mod, I continued the pace that I had set in the previous one.  I volunteered for several Turing events (including running the Turing tent at the Taste of Ethiopia festival and Boulder Pride) and also have gotten involved as one of the main broadcasters on the Turing podcast.  I am also still regularly attending the Imposters posse lunches, and I offered pairing assistance to all who asked.  I am getting a lot out of volunteering for these events, and I plan on continuing to do so.  In the future Mods, I want to dive head first into cold outreach, and try to network as much as possible.  If I could get myself some job shadowing experiences, that would be ideal.  I want to continue putting myself out there and assist my fellow Turing students as much as I can.  I have also currently volunteered for the Q&A session this weekend at our Try Coding event.  I would like to sign up for a Front End TA position for one of those weekends during the next Mod, too.
