# Alexander Ela - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

1. To become more comfortable with not understanding programming concepts at first and to better prevent myself from sinking into panic or despair as a result of comparing myself to other classmates.

2. To develop more fluency with array prototype methods and with being more decisive with working in Javascript in general.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
I received generally positive feedback on the majority of my end of module assessment.
I did struggle a little bit with refactoring the array prototype problem I was given, although I did manage to get the desired result.  I suspect that much of my struggle was due to nerves, as I strongly believe that I put a significant and sustained amount of effort in practicing array prototype methods daily, both in pairs and on my own.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects in this module consisted of two assignments, which consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

#### 1. Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This assignment required me to develop and implement a system of logic based around complex data structures to devise an autocomplete feature for an application.

##### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
##### Evaluation: Comments
My evaluator's comments were mostly positive, with him recommending that I complete a decent amount of refactoring of my code to make it more efficient.

#### 2. React Static Comp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/ae-react-static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-starter-kit/tree/react-static-comp)

This project required me to rebuild a provided static comp using React. The primary goal of this (ungraded) assignment was to provide me with a structured, initial opportunity to become acquainted with React.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects in this module consisted of two assignments completed by groups of two, including myself and another classmate. These assignments consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

#### 1. Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Create a playable game using HTML based on the classic arcade game, "Snake".

##### Students: Alexander Ela and Mark Pearyer
##### Evaluator: Brittany Storoz
##### Evaluation: 
###### Comments:
* Cute snake :) Though it needs its own class
* Some refactoring opportunities for methods and properties for particular objects, but decent demonstration that OOP skills are in place

###### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

###### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

* Solid refactoring to include the Snake class & test it over the weekend but with tests like [this](https://github.com/alexanderela/game-time/blob/master/test/snake-test.js#L55-L59) make sure you are asserting a particular length first, then calling `growSnake`, then asserting the new length. Tough for me to tell by this test alone if the snake always has a length of 9 or if it's actually growing. What's it's original length?

###### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.


###### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

* Really nice commit messages - consistent and readable. A+!

* Try to never commit commented out code, like [here](https://github.com/alexanderela/game-time/commit/02ca49aad42c06ae1117475dac551c3cdf14538e). If you were to pull request this, it would make it really hard for the other developer to read the diff and understand exactly what's happening.


#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/Weathrly/tree/master/weathrly-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This assignment required me and my partner to construct a weather application using React and drawing realtime weather data from the Weather Underground API.

##### Students: Alexander Ela and Freddie Levenson
##### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
##### Evaluation: 

###### Project Organization
* Group related component, test, and CSS files in related folders.
* Focus on requirements for minimum viable product FIRST before working on features such as degree unit toggle.


###### Testing
* Use .simulate() Enzyme method to test Search component.



## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did my best to maintain a positive attitude and growth mindset among my classmates even when many people were stressed and cranky such as during the Complete Me project.  I encouraged people who expressed self-doubt to me and offered to help them when I thought I could be of assistance. Most importantly, I made it a top priority to treat everyone with respect and kindness and to ask questions in class that were relevant and that would help clarify fundamental concepts for myself and others.
