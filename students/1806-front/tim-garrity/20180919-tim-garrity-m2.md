# Tim Garrity - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I really set out to prove to myself that I could code something without being hand held through the entire process. There is definitely room to improve (always) but I feel like I have finally gotten my first taste of what it feels like to have something work and it be entirely my own doing. Of course, feedback will always be important but this skill of being able to accomplish a task independently was something I had struggled with.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Complete Me)

It has been said before and I shall say it again, this project was difficult. It was probably the most challenging piece of code that I have ever been challenged to write. I ended up coming up with an answer but I am not sure that I am totally satisfied with my entire process. There ended up being a lot of group work time that I wish I had spent on my own as I believe I could have found a more suitable answer for what I needed rather than rely on something that I partially owned.

Moreover, the project could have been more focused for me given the eventual revealed object of wanting us to focus on our problem solving and whatnot, but I understand the need for obscurity with as the code was still needed later for Weatherly. 

At the end of the day what’s done is done but I wish there just a little more Tim in the code that was written.

(evaluation comments)
Pam’s main takeaways for me were to continue utilizing the whiteboard to its fullest potential and to not rely heavily upon patterns that I had picked up upon in my original implementation. Overall, there were solid critical thinking techniques and the problem solving process would be benefitted by mapping out diagrams to keep my place.

### Projects

#### (Game-Time)

Game time ended being an interesting foray into the unknown for Sara and I. We both had to come to terms with the semi-ominous phrase “everything is an object”. Looking back I am so glad that we were made to do this project as I feel like my understanding of this vital piece of javascript and OOP has increased ten-fold.

That said, it was also a difficult exercise in knowing what to prioritize when it comes to the work that needs to be completed. At first were laser-focused on testing and found that we both did not have the skills necessary to predict what our testing needed to look like and didn’t understand how to mock out data for the already existing functions in our code base. We later found that trying to any work with the <canvas> api to be an absolute nightmare and quickly abandoned any further intimacy.

Overall I think the project did accomplish its goals of teaching OOP and we have a cool product to improve upon for future show casing.

# Game Time
* Students: Sara & Tim
* Evaluator: Brittany

Comments:
* Some opportunities for refactoring and improving naming conventions for methods/variables
* Demonstrated solid understanding of OOP classes and where behavior/values belong

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

* Gh-pages deploy

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

* Good job testing the frog over the weekend, testing overall still needs a bit more work and focus but you will have more opportunities to do that throughout the inning

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.

* Nice refactoring from if/elses to switches and clean index.js file, doing no more than it needs to

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

* Commit messages need to be formatted in a clean, consistent manner. Write your message to follow [these](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) rules

* Lots of commits with commented out code and console.logs, you can use `git stash` to temporarily remove changes that you don't want to commit


#### (Weatherly)

Weatherly was a challenge that I approached a bit different this time around. I had committed to sticking around for a while to complete various tasks after school and I believe this was responsible for the surprising (for me at least) quality of our finished product. 

I was unsure how Mark and I would interact at first as there was many a time that I had felt he was someone up on a pedestal and far away from the realm that I was working in. These notions were quickly dashed aside as he was working on the same level as me, intentionally so or not is a mystery, but this allowed us to foster a healthy working relationship. Often we would sit at the monitor for a few hours and grind through problems, taking poms of course, and eventually come up with a solution that both of us understood and we happy with implementing. I think Weatherly is my finest accomplishment so far, and with some tweaking could be ready to show potential employers in the near future.

All notes we took from while speaking with Brittany:

labels on highs and lows
change the placeholder to search
subheadings for 7hour and 10day
everything is too big
differentiate between whats important
api key and mock data  subdirectory and ulits or helpers folder
rename node to trie
separate request in a const
next to your imports
with fetch request explicitly throw something for 400 errorcodes

always have a .catch
alerts are going to be deprecated
handlesearchcahnge not a great name
name things based on the logic inside (edited)
redux waiting on fetch request lookup?
single quotes or double quotes
change the levels dev tools
dont do what we did in card.js

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I believe I support the Turing community by putting away dishes and starting the dishwasher at night… But seriously, I am a clean freak and y’all’s dirty dishes are nasty.

My other my addition is honestly my sincere engagement with the community as a whole. I try to partake in the group activities whole-heartedly and attend different posse meetings to get to know everyone better. We are all busy but there is certainly time to interact more with people who will be our peers in the workplace.
