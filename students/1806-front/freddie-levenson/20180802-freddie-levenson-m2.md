# Freddie Levenson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
 
I definitely spent extra time this module focusing on better time management. I also did my best to not let myself get to my head, as in the past that has led to over-confidence, allowing me to study less than was necessary. I think I improved on both of these areas but there is still a ways to go. Another area of emphasis was breaking a problem down into more manageable smaller pieces as a means of problem solving, and I think I definitely improved upon this as the mod went on. I definitely think there is a lot of improvement to do in all of this, but I know where to focus next round and over break week.

 ## A: End of Module Assessment
 
I feel I did very well on the end of module assessment. While I fumbled a little on the object literal during the array prototype the general consensus was that I understood what I was doing, nerves just got the best of me and I tried to use bracket notation for no reason. I feel my answers to the technical questions were great though, and that my array prototype skills are strong.

 ## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
The individual projects this module consisted of two assignments:
 
#### 1. Complete Me
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This assignment was a huge challenge. Individually we were asked to create a working prefix trie and to be able to implement this in future projects as an auto-complete feature. We were asked to write the sorting algorithms ourselves, allowing you to suggest a list of words, whether it be 5 words, the entire dictionary, or a list of cities, and it would sort the words properly into a trie.
 
##### Evaluator: Pam
##### Evaluation: Comments

Pam said that I definitely need to work on my process a bit more. She said that I wrote too much code during whiteboarding and was not general enough. This led to the whiteboarding session taking much longer than it should have. The pseudo-coding portion I also spoke too much, without writing enough pseudo-code to go along with it. She said this led to the impression I may be stalling or did not fully understand the question or my process. I think I learned the most from this eval out of any eval in a while. I know I have a lot of stuff to work on in terms of nerves, and live-coding or whiteboarding out a problem.

 #### 2. React Static Comp
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/react-static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-starter-kit/tree/react-static-comp)

 This assignment was our first assignment using react. It was an ungraded assignment asking us to recreate a static page using react. It was great practice in using react and allowed us to gain experience in it before our first big react project.

 ## C: Group Work & Projects
 
 ### Projects
 
There were two projects in the module that were group projects, Game-time which consisted of building a classic game in htmlCanvas, and Weathrly, which was an opportunity to create a weather app using React.
 
 #### 1. Game Time
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/djcaraballo/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

 We were required to create a playable version of the classic game Tron using ES6, OOP, and HTML canvas. It was a great exercise in being able to manage numerous files, in being able to handle using boilerplate code and manipulate it to do as you needed, and in using ES6 arrow functions and classes to create a complex object oriented application. We were also asked to test it ourselves.
 
 ##### Students: Freddie Levenson and Dina Caraballo.
 
##### Evaluator: Brittany Storoz
##### Evaluation: 

###### Comments:

Our evaluator told us that we had to make the following fixes to receive a 4 for functionality:

* fix the bug for the orange path when the game is over and the canvas clears
* test the game class with the it blocks we wrote out
* rename the blocks to players
* refactor that if/else statement in the `handleKeyPress`

We made these changes by monday for our evaluator.

Brittany also recommended that we revise our interface to make it more readable and user friendly. We also accomplished this. These were our main points of feedback, and also to maybe reach out for help sooner. We dug ourselves in a bit of a rabbit hole which could have been avoided, but I feel we were very successful with this project.

 #### Weathrly
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/Weathrly/tree/master/weathrly-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

This assignment asked my partner and I to create a weather application. We used the weather underground API to get live updating weather data and also making any city searchable. We were required to have a current forecast as well as a 7 hour and 10 day forecast. We built the entire project using react, tested it ourselves, and also created our own UI ourselves.
 
##### Students: Freddie Levenson and Alexander Ela
##### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
##### Evaluation: 

###### Project Organization
 
* Group related component, test, and CSS files in related folders.
* Focus on requirements for minimum viable product FIRST before working on features such as degree unit toggle.

###### Testing
 
* Use .simulate() Enzyme method to test Search component.

## D: Community Participation
 
### Playing a Part
 
I feel I played a great part of the Turing community. I spent extensive hours pairing with Mod 1 students and even occaisionally my classmates when they needed help on a concept that I understood. I often tried to lighten the mood when tensions were high, whether it was with a joke or with some board-game or card-game. I also tried to lighten the mood whenever possible while working on projects, whether they were group projects or individual, making people laugh along the way and turning the project into something fun rather than an assignment. I also did my best to contribute to the class conversation in a fair amount, rather than dominating the conversation. I am not always the best at this. I tried occasionally to ask a clarifying question, even if it were a concept that I understood, because making sure I understood the concept was important, but sometimes hearing a concept explained by someone else is very helpful. I also did my best to take in any feedback offered by classmates. Sometimes there is just something I do not know about myself or the way that I phrased something, and it was a pleasure learning from those around me as well as the teachers.
