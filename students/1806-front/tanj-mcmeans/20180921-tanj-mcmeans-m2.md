# Tanjie McMeans - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I really focused on trying to develop my JS skills, work better through my terminal, build up my terminology and logical thinking skills in order to progress towards being interview-ready after graduation. Mod2 was incredibly difficult, but I feel like I took away a lot of useful and important CS concepts that will benefit me during interviews when I start job hunting. Throughout the mod, the instructors stressed how important it was for students to practice thinking about problems and pseudo-coding them, whiteboarding and thinking of concepts like the callstack, scope chains and recursion under the hood on a deeper level and be able to explain these concepts to a potential interviewer. Overall, I feel very accomplished in my ability to understand Javascript, as well as explain crucial programmatic concepts in a straightforward way.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/TMcMeans/game-time
* [Original Assignment]http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

Learn object oriented programming (OOP) principles by building a game that is playable in the browser.

reset game, multiple lives / score, not be turn on self
move addScore inside of player, handle player refactor,
Test that player path is growing
Test two player collision

Functional Expectations
2 - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

Testing
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested. ESLint shows 5+ complaints.

JavaScript Style & OOP
2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Application is organized into classes that do not display a good understanding of encapsulation, and logic is not well-divided. Developer cannot articulate what each line of code is doing. There are one or more major bugs.

Workflow
3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.

#### CompleteMe

A trie is a data structure in computer science. The word trie is derived from the word retrieval (as in re-trie-val).
Now there are many types of tries and one you will hear a lot about is the binary search trie. It is similar to a linked list the difference being that each child node has a single left and right node attached to it.
The benefits of something like a trie is that it makes dealing with large sets of data easier to handle.

#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/TMcMeans/weatherly
* [Original Assignment]http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html

It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all).
As web developers you’re going to be living in the context of the web. With this next project you will be interacting with a web-api. Ultimately this is going to be a preview for what the real world is going to look like for most of you. Data is important and thats what the API provides. As a web-developer you will be giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for your user base.
In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I volunteered to work at the Turing booth for Boulder Pride this mod. I also helped foster diversity, solidarity, community and awareness amongst Turing students of color by working with Joanne to host a Turing Students of Color Social Night event.
