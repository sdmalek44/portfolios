# Tobin Nelson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal in Mod 2 was to become more confident and comfortable working with Javascript. I was glad to hear the mod was going to focus heavily on Javascript fundamentals, and looking back I feel confident that I was able to make solid progress in my Javascript skills. Another goal I had was to bring more complete and solid projects into my evals. I wanted to be sure I could explain and talk through my code with confidence and in detail. Also, I wanted to understand and see just how testing gets implemented as it was only breifly covered in Mod 1. Finally, I think a lot about what it means to be a successful student at Turing, the positive habits that support my growth, and what it will take to reach my goals. Mod 1 was about discovering these things for myself, on my terms. I think Mod 2 was about perfecting that process and solidifying these ideas and habits for myself.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Description: In this project I created a prefix trie. The ultimate goal was to implement the data structure into the Weathrly project as an autocomplete feature. The expectation was that we create a data structure that allows you to input words into the trie. It would track the number of words in the trie. And finally it would return a list of suggested words when the prefix of a word was entered.

Evaluation comments: I whiteboarded out how the trie works when different words are inputted. Nathaniel asked me to implement the suggest function in code. I was able to successfuly write the code and describe what was happening in this function. Nathaniel gave me a few refactoring ideas for how my suggest function was working.

Evaluation scores: Pass


## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/game-time)
* [GitHub Pages](https://benjaminhayek.github.io/game-time/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Description: Ben and I recreated the classic Frogger arcade game. Using canvas and Object Oriented Programming we were able to build the game. We used OOP to organize our code and leveraged classes and inheritance to make instances of all the game pieces. Through HTML canvas, we were able to animate the pieces, creating a fully functional game. Finally, for this project we implemented a test suite that tested all the main functionality of the game.

Evaluation comments: Pam gave us some feedback about our user interface and some small improvements to be made. We also discussed some opportunities for refactoring parts of the code.

Evaluation Scores: Pass

Feedback from Partner: Ben and I completed the feedback conversation as we were taught in the PD sessions. Both of us agreed it was a successful pairing and project. We discussed how clear communication allowed us to work through the problems we encountered and deliver a successful project in our evaluation


#### Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/weathrly)

Description: Casey and I created a functioning weather app that provides users with current weather conditions across the United States, including 7 hour forecasts and 10 day forecasts. Weathrly was our introduction into using React and building out a UI with components. Our app fetches the weather data using the Wunderground Weather API. In addition, we used Enzyme and Jest to test the components, covering all major functionality on the App.

Evaluation Comments: Pam made some helpful suggestions about the App. The project was in need of some small adjustments, like improving error messaging connected to the API fetch calls. She also highlighted some areas for refactoring, specifically grouping some different functions together which were working with the data recieved from the API, and putting them in their own file. Finally she highlighted a few components that could benefit from more robust testing.

Evaluation Scores: Pass

Feedback from Partner: Casey was very encouraging and supportive of me as a partner. We agreed the project went well, we were happy with the product we brought to the evaluation, and felt that while we hit many challenges along the way, we communicated well through them and reached out for help when appropriate.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I try my best to support the community here at Turing. This mod I had the opportunity to pair with stduents in Mod 1 which was a great experiecnce and I would welcome more opportunities for that in the future. Further, in PD and gear up sessions, I try to take them very seriously as I belive they are important to building the sense of community. During the break out discussions in those sessions I always try to be engaged and offer ideas and opinions. I'm looking forward to continuing to be a part of the Turing community in Mod 3.
