# Derek Hanciles - M2 Portofolio


# Areas of Emphasis 

###### 
For this module my goals were to improve my problem solving skills, to consistently demonstrate the habits of a web developer, 
and embrace the new concepts of es6 and display the ability to implement this new syntax. 

# A: End of Module Assestment

######
Throughout this module I have embraced the new challeneges and concepts introduced mod 2. I have demonstrated the abiblity to 
implement and speak on these concepts at a high level while working on my projects and during evaluations. 
There have been points of adversity that I have used for growth and come through those adverse situations a better developer. 
With all I have learned, retained, and experienced this module, I am confident that I will be success moving on to mod 3.

# B: Group Work & Projects
# Gametime
######
This project my and my partner created a 2d version of the game Tron. We used object-oriented programming for organization to 
encapsulate our apps features and functionality. This was my first time implementing a project with TDD, where I learned the 
iimportance of testing, and what actually needs to be tested. There was also additional professional growth during this project 
and I was able to use Turings resources for support and guidance.

- Evaluator: Brittany
###### Comments:
- Many opportunities for refactoring, removing dead or unused code, and making long if/else conditions a bit more readable
- Some instances where methods and properties are on the wrong classes and should be moved to a more appropriate place
- Seemed to have a difficult pairing with working styles/collaborating on solving problems
- Worked really hard to get changes in over the weekend

###### Functional Expectations 
- 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

###### User Interface 
- 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
- Scores on the DOM aren't in the best spot, and text is tiny in comparison to the rest of the game

###### Testing
- 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. 
- All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

###### JavaScript Style & OOP
- 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. 
- Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. 
- Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. 
- Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made 
 in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.
 
 ###### Workflow
 - 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. 
  There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) 
  and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
 
 - Not sure what kind of github issues you were having, but in general we need to have more commits than we do. 
  Commit smaller changesets more frequently rather than doing a ton of work all at once before committing it. 
  This will help ensure that you don't lose a ton of work if something goes wrong, 
  and will allow you to more easily rollback your repo to a previous state.
  
  # Weatherly 
  ######
  My first was React project was the most fun I've had working on any project so far at Turing. My paretener and my self 
  had a very smooth collaboration and we both grew as developers from a standpoint of learning a new concept and buidling an app
  based on user needs and not our own. This was also my first opportunity implement React testing in a project with my project
  and that challenge helped me grow as well.

# C: Individual Work & Projects

# Complete-Me
####### 
In this project I created a prefix trie. This project was slightly different from others there was no UI/UX. 
I was challeged to implementent test, and methods that allowed me to build my data structure and also find words, and suggest words
in the data structure. My evaluation for this evalution was a whiteboarding session to demonstrate my undertanding for how my methods 
were built and then implementing my thought process into code.

# D: Community Participation

######
During this module I played my part in the community, by offering a helping hand to people in my cohort, to work on understanding
and implementing these new concepts we have learned. This helped me tremendously as well too. I also so the 
tough strain that this module had on multiple people in my cohort and I was able to reach out 
and be an ear that could listen to what they were going, and not be quick to suggestions or using my voice, just listening. 
I enjoy being apart of this communitity and enjoy growing with it.
