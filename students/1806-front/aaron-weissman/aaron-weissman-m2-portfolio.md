# Aaron Weissman Mod 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was partly to learn the subject matter that was being taught, but was also largely to try to improve my ability to figure out and solve things on my own. With every project, I am of course looking to follow the spec sheet and to achieve the learning goals of that particular project, but I also try to push myself to learn something else that might further my ability to problem solve in the future. For example, for the auto-complete functionality of the Weatherly project, I really wanted to take into account both how many times a particular location had been searched, but also to add in something that tracked recency as well. I was able to build an algorithm that tracked both of those things and sorted suggestions based on a combination of those two factors.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The projects this mod were all very different and presented a wide range of unique challenges. Gametime and Weatherly were both paired projects and Complete Me was individual. One of the biggest things that I improved on over all three projects was my use of git and GitHub. During Gametime, I was away at a wedding over the weekend, so James and I really had to communicate through code in order to make sure we were on the same page. Then, during Complete Me, I was on my own, so I was not as religious about having a lot of commits. In hindsight, I should have and realized this upon completion of the project. Building on what I'd learned over the first two projects, I was able to use GitHub effectively with my partner while continuing to try to force myself into good habits.

#### Complete Me

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

There are no evaluation scores available for Complete Me. 

I had a good experience with Complete Me overall, although I got completely stuck a couple of times and needed some help to figure out different issues I faced. Specifically, when it came to the autosuggest functionality I got to a point where I could return the correct words, but they were returning three times due to the way I'd put together the Node. Pam helped me clean up the Node so that it returned each word just once.


## C: Group Work & Projects

##### Evaluation Scores
User Interface - 3
Testing - 3
Javascript Style & OOP - 3
Workflow - 3

##### Feedback
I enjoyed working with James. We did not have any official feedback sessions, but we communicated throughout the project and had a debrief after it was complete. 

#### Weatherly

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weatherly was a lot of fun and it felt good to have a screen to work with again after using just the terminal during Complete Me. I wish I'd had more time to do more, and I think our design was more niche than we may have hoped. I learned a ton though and look forward to refactoring it to be a more user friendly app.

##### Feedback
Ashton and I gave one another verbal feedback after the completion of the project. I think we worked well together, and had good communication throughout. We did a combination of live and remote pairing and used git consistantly to keep our code up to date.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I helped support the larger community through pairing and doing my part to keep the space clean and neat. Pairing and helping other students was a big help for my own learning this mod. When forced to explain things outloud, I was able to figure out aspects of JavaScript that I hadn't previously realized. In addition, seeing what ways I could help mod-oners was a good reminder of how much we've already learned.
