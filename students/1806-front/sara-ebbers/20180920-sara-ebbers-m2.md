#  Sara Ebbers - (M2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

It was my goal to continue to practice writing vanilla JS, to learn ES-6, practice array prototype methods, and gain exposure to React.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For Mod 2, I completed Complete-Me.  Additionally I worked through array prototype methods with the Iron FE group several mornings per week.  

####Complete-Me
* https://saraebbers.github.io/complete-me/.
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html

Description: The goal of this project was to learn about structuring data by building a prefix trie that can be utilized by another program to make suggestions during search functionality. 

Evaluation comments:
PASS
no written evaluation comments provided.  I utilized white-boarding to explain nodes and how the trie functioned.   White-boarding opportunity for growth included providing less detail during explanation.  

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

For mod2 I completed two Paired Projects using canvas and React.  I paired frequently in both a formal and informal manner.  

#### GameTime

* https://saraebbers.github.io/game-time/
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

Description: The goal of this project was to learn object oriented programming (OOP) principles by building a game (Frogger) that is playable in the browser.  We were provided a starter kit and built the game.  The project included utilizing testing in development.  

Evaluation comments:
PASS

#### Weathrly

*  https://saraebbers.github.io/weathrlyProjectModTwo/
*  http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html

Description: This project served as an introduction to React and the use of APIs.  Additionally we incorporated our prefix trie for search functionality.  We continue to learn how to utilize testing for app development.  This project required connection to mock data and mock functionality to ensure testing. 

Evaluation comments:
PASS
no written evaluation comments provided.  We were asked to add testing, and given suggestions on design as well as opportunities to refactor.   


## D: Professional Skills

During our professional skill development time we continue to work on providing feedback to peers and are now providing this feedback in person.  I continue to utilize relationship defining talks prior to group projects.  Additionally, we are working toward succinctly presenting our professional story to share with future employers.  

### Agile

This gear-up helped to focus on agile development.  My greatest take-away from the agile talk was the difference between being agile vs doing agile. Being Agile relates to how I and/or my team thinks about doing something vs how I and/or my team work in changes in response to demands. The process of engineering, either relationships or code requires flexibility and a willingness to relinquish control of a project for the sake of creating the best deliverable. Though I may have a vision of how something should work or exist, ultimately it is the interaction between my client / partner that determines if we have produced that best product. What good is a game if no one wants to play it? What good is an app if it doesn't meet the needs of the client. I have only begun my efforts to integrate agile into my coding career, but I see the value. Considering my Weatherly project. I immediately recognized the way I use a weather application may vary from someone else. The importance of snow for a skier is significantly different than for the nonskiier... so the importance I gave in incorporating what I thought to be vital information differed from my partner. It was fun to show peers the application and to watch them interact with it. I am excited to see how applications are built out and additional components added based on user interaction. In future projects I hope to be more deliberate in adding components one at a time, so that I can more fully vet out potential bugs, and have them in a useable format for peers to test and provide feedback. I hope to learn how to utilize wire framing that can develop and grow based on the slow addition of each component. That way I can get feedback about what others want to see added, even if that is already in the works, I can listen for their idea on what that may look like, rather than tightly holding onto my image of with it may look like. This will help me to build a more user friendly application. 

### Attention Economy
Reflection: if you attention is a scarce resource, how are you spending it?  This gear-up focused on methods used to gain attention and asked the difficult question of how you balance ethics with business strategy to drive financial support for tech development.  We reflected on our own use of technology and how it is impacted by different attention grabbing/keeping techniques.  

#### Happiness
This gear-up encouraged reflection on time investment and how we can continuously incorporate that activities that encourage us to have balance in our daily lives, and that provide us inspiration.  It is easy, especially in an intense academic program or difficult work project to lose sight of the things that fuel us.  We were encouraged to consider ways to incorporate happiness into our breaks.  This gear up also helped us to consider what type of environment we want to create in our future careers.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

What a great community to be a part of!  I continue to maintain health and balance by taking the opportunity to walk with my peers during lunch.   I regularly participated in ironFE, and have served as a pairing partner with mod1 students, as well as utilized pairing with mod3 students.   I have swerved as a sounding board/confidant to peers who need to discuss personal matters.   I continue to meet with my mentor on a regular basis.
