# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- Attend the optional things
- Learn a lot
- Ask a lot of questions and turn to Google a lot for implementations and tricks
- Ask about and try to pursue best practices
I'd say I was successful at these goals.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled some with paired projects. I tried to be sensitive of other's paces,
but I haven't quite got it figured out and balanced yet. My partners were very
different, but in both cases we didn't set 'due times/dates' and worked at our own
paces. Both times, this led to me picking up more work (which was fine and fun),
but I wonder if my partners would have liked the opportunity to contribute more.
Frankly though, the projects were completed with no extra time, so I'm conflicted
on if I should pull back some. I will say that giving partners space to do what
they took on without a deadline, may have caused worse communication about the
completeness of tasks and we ran into a couple of last minute binds and surprises,
which would be nice to avoid in the future. I think to improve, I have to initiate
more conversations about task status and also maybe aim to make deadlines for tasks
or at leasts deadlines for updates about the tasks. It's hard at this point to make
good time estimations of tasks, but that's also something to think harder about /
pay more attention too.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I really liked all the projects. Each taught me something valuable and different.
I also liked that the weekly challenges were aligned pretty well with what we
needed to do in our projects - so I felt comfortable and prepared for the challenges
as well. I guess I disliked BattleShip most because I felt out of the loop on certain
things; a lot of pretty much required knowledge were word of mouth, like the project
etiquette lesson plan that wasn't on the agenda and was never mentioned in class. I also
really disliked that I had to prompt the user in my code, but didn't even know I could
even skip that part in my tests. It made testing very long and tedious and I still
don't really know how I could avoid this in the future. Maybe that project felt more
frustrating than of good informative learning.


What did you learn from your independent projects?

I think the independent projects were a confidence boost more than anything else.
I felt pretty good about diving in, pacing myself, and being the only thing in the
way of my success. I never really got blocked on any of the projects, but especially
on the independent ones, I never had to wait for anyone's contribution or wait to
have a conversation about how to proceed. While that's fine and dandy, I did
come to Turing to work with people, and while group projects are not my favorite part
specifically, I do think it's the most important part.



What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that it's hard to maintain 'your' working style in a group, or at least
in a pair, and that the success of the project really depends on finding the right
group working style - so go into these projects with an open mind. I think it's
also really important to have a good grasp of what the group members are actually
doing in their contributions; not just from a grand idea perspective, but rather
like knowing what enumerables they chose and why. Maybe that's too much on real
products, but the more you know about all of the code, the better pieces come together.



## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I went to a couple of lunch activities, and the optional whole-school activities.
I did the Arduino lesson and got a few other people to come too. I went to the
code fair. I also attended all of the optional talks, which I find really valuable
and hope to see more of next mod. I also liked to stick around during non-class hours
and be available to help with or chat about projects. I really like our cohort.



What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'd like to work with mod1, but see initiating or prioritizing that as an obstacle.
I'd also like to get in on the wellness activities and goals, which I think it's
really great that the school not only supports but emphasizes; I didn't manage to
make wellness-balancing work beyond like 2 days a week. I also want to go out with
my cohort more, but spending money and drinking are not my ...best idea of fun, so
maybe I'll bring up some group hikes or something.
