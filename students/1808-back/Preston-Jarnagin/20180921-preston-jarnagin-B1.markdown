# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?  
- I set out to establish a base understanding of Ruby and how to use it to build simple applications. I also wanted to be sure that development is a career path I want to embark upon.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- Coming into mod 1, I didn't have a great understanding of my working style, how I solve problems, and how I communicate and work with others. Going through the process of having to solve technical problems taught me a lot about who I am.
- I also struggled a lot with designing code that is clean and reusable. I wrote a lot of code that was repeating what I had already done, and I ended up with some really long classes and methods. That taught me to consider a problem and it's solutions before diving in.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- I think my favorite was battleship because it gave me a chance to prove to myself that I can go from zero code to something functioning with very little direction. Before that project I wasn't sure I'd be able to operate without the "training wheels" that came with the spec sheet of the previous projects. I also loved both paired projects because I loved getting to work with other people to solve problems.
- I liked all the projects, but if I had to pick a least favorite it would probably be sorting cards just because all the other projects felt like they left a lot of room for exploration.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- Use the pomodoro method. Design a solution before trying to implement it.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
- I was worried I wouldn't be able to effectively code with others because I had never done it before and, in my mind, code always seemed like a solo activity. I was completely wrong. Coding with others allows projects to be completed so much more efficiently, and it allows you to learn from and teach others. Every time I came away from a paired coding session, I felt energized and felt like I had learned something new.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- In my own cohort, I felt like I able to offer meaningful help to other students when I saw they were struggling. Outside of my cohort I joined a few posses and made an effort to meet people from other mods and the front-end program.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I want to offer help and guidance to the incoming students just as the students in 1806 gave to me.
- There was an opportunity I had to join some fellow students to help out at Boulder Pride, and I passed it up because I had convinced myself that I was in no position to talk about Turing to prospective students because I wouldn't know what I was talking about. I regret that and when another opportunity arises to help the community that really interests me, I should take it.
