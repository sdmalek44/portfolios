## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
My goal this module was to learn the basics of Ruby programming and that was about it because I honestly knew so little that I didn't know how to articulate any other goals.  After getting into it, I realized I also needed to learn the tools associated with programming: the terminal, atom, git, github, gems, etc.  As for the first goal, I almost can't believe how much I've learned in the last 6 weeks.  In particular, I feel way more confident with TDD, utilization enumerables, understanding the scope of variables, the importance of knowing return values, the differences between command and query methods, class interaction and troubleshooting errors.  Even just listing out all of items makes me feel like I've learned another language.  As for the tools, I think I've gotten much better at using them but I don't full truly proficient in their use.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Whenever I started to learn any new concept, I think I struggled.  It made sense in class, but then when I started to apply the concept in an actual project, I had to make sense of the concept again.  So in general, that was a struggle.  Specifically, I think nested collections are a struggle and continue to be one for me.  Keeping all the different variables in my head at once can be challenging (though it gave me great opportunity to practice my pry skills).  Opening files and writing to files is a bit fuzzy since we didn't practice it too much though I think I could figure it out. As for tools, I think I struggled a lot when a new tool was introduced since usually the explanations provided for those tools were pretty thin (tools like rake, simplecov, or spec harness).  I had to rely a lot on my classmates for those kinds of things.  What I learned from my struggles is that, typically, if I can just spend some time thinking through something, I can figure it out.  One day I would feel like I really didn't get something, and then suddenly, the next day, it made sense.  I've learned that repetition is important for me.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Black Thursday was pretty fun for me because a) my teammate and I complemented each other well and b) it felt like a project that I might utilize in a real job.  It was also fun to practice something I was still solidifying: utilizing different nested enumerables.  My least favorite was probably Battleship.  Although I ended up finishing the project, it was a huge challenge for me.  I think I was still struggling with the concept of class interaction and so it took a lot of brain power for me to problem solve my issues.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that I need to read the spec sheet right when it's assigned and let the information mellow in my head for a bit.  Then I need to spend some time strategizing the design of the project.  I also learned that I need to understand there are a bazillion ways to design a solution and so just because someone is designing the program differently, doesn't mean I need to start over.  

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned that I definitely prefer to work with a partner than independently on a project.  I love thinking through solutions out loud so it's nice to have another person to bounce ideas off of.  I am also a firm believer that two heads is better than one so having more ideas to solve a problem creates a better solution to the problem.  I think I learned a lot from my partners as well.  Rene taught me a lot about reading and writing to files and Preston taught me his nifty keyboard shortcuts and a way to write enumerables in enumerables.  The DTR was very useful in both partner projects as we were able to set up appropriate expectations for each other from the get-go.  

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
Honestly, contributing to the Turing community wasn't the biggest object for myself this module.  Because I went into this module knowing next to nothing about coding, I really wanted to focus on my person learning.  However, if I saw another classmate struggling or seeming a bit 'off', I made an effort to ask how things were going and let them air their frustrations.  I attended a few posse meetings for fitness and for the JCS, though I ended up focusing more on projects than attending those meetings.  I made tons of pots of coffee and I cleaned up the kitchen from time to time.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I think being more involved with posses next module will be a goal.  Consistently attending the JCS posse and maybe helping to co-run a lunchtime running posse to help with stress-relief.
