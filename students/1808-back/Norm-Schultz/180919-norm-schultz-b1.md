# Norm Schultz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this mod were to develop a general coding process and to become comfortable with moving from specifics (such as syntax) to generalities (such as abstraction and data flow). I believe I was successful in both, though the former will be ongoing. I'm a huge fan of TDD and have developed good habits regarding white boarding and note taking. 

The two things I've struggled with the most were the program's pace and partner pairing. Coming from academia, I'm used to a slower, more deliberate and contemplative pace of learning. Pairing had it's inherent challenges, working with different styles and the other imperfections that almost always arise from human communication. 

## Projects

*What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?*

I really liked Battleship because it reminded me of the simple video games I used to play when I was a kid. We just didn't have enough time, IMO. I intend to finish programming the game and putting a playable version on my website.

I didn't like Black Thursday because of not knowing what spec harness was doing or why.

*What did you learn from your independent projects?*

I learned how to code faster and how to ask the right questions when seeking help.

*What did you learn from your paired projects?*

I learned to compromise and how to hold my ground on something important.

## Community

*How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?*

I frequently ask in-class questions with the entire class in mind, i.e. asking for clarification to ensure that everyone understands a concept. I've also been giving one-on-one counsel and feedback on things like pairing, test anxiety, and writing.

*What would you like to do to contribute next module?*

I can help with writing, TDD, psuedocode, and general workflow.
