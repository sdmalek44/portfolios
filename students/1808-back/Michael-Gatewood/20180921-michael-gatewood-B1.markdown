# Michael Gatewood - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into BE-Mod1, I wanted to gain a good understanding of Ruby.  I feel like I have learned enough Ruby to be able to tackle any challenge presented to me.  I am very satisfied with my level of proficiency and I am able to complete challenges in a short period when compared to how I performed in the front-end program.  After struggling with TDD for the entire FE program, TDD is now one of my favorite aspects of programming with Ruby.

My biggest struggle has been being patient with my project partners.  I'm not used to being the most experienced of the group; as my front-end peers were consistently at or above my level of proficiency.  It has been an adjustment and is something I will continue to work on.

## Projects

My favorite projects were all of the individual projects.  I really enjoy seeing what problems I can solve in a short period of time and treat it like practice for a code challenge that a potential employer might give to candidates.

My least favorite project is iteration 4 of Black Thursday.  The spec was vague and we had to throw a lot of shit at the wall to determine the requirements.  I don't feel that this particular exercise made me a better software developer.

## Community

My biggest contribution to the community has probably been related to my experience using git and GitHub.  I have often been a resource for others when they are presented with new challenges and how to get out of a pinch with git.

I've also found myself helping others debug quite often.  Having used console.log for debugging for so long, Ruby and pry are a welcomed change.

I presume that my front-end experience will come into play in Mod2 and my classmates can count on me as a resource for html and css-related problems.
