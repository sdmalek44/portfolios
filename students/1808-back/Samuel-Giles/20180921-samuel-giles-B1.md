# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to increase my competency in the fundamentals of Ruby.  I was successful with enhancing my skillsets with arrays, hashes, objects, modules and especially enumerable use.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

In between lectures, meetings and the overall Turing experience, I struggled with managing to find time for independent study.  I learned that focused independent study and research are critical components for me to increase understanding, competency and new information retention.   

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Despite all of the hoopla, I enjoyed Black Thursday the most. Black Thursday is a very practical project simulating business transactions. However, I think the project would be even more be beneficial if students had more time to assess / challenge assumptions and refactor.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned the importance of design principles and how to manage competing project design and code development time commitments.  

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned to rely on my classmates and students from other modules for advise in paired arrangements.  Pairing projects can be difficult if communication is not core to the arrangement.  

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I presented to the Turing administration an opportunity to acquire best-in-class robotic process automation academic training kit for FREE.  This training kit would permit Turing

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to start a posse for students interested in learning more about Robotic Process Automation, in general, and using some of the leading RPA software in applications.
