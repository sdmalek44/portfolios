## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I honestly set out to get versed in how programming *works*, how to do it, and how to understand breaking big problems down into tiny steps.  I also set out to get REALLY good at data types, and getting basic syntax down. I totally succeeded at all of these things. I also set out to expand my leadership skills, and I absolutely demonstrated leadership and expanded those skills in many different areas throughout Turing. Oh, also, I didn't set out to learn this, but, I got REALLY good at debugging step by step like, literally the last week.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with mastering specific tools quickly enough to use them with ease. I consistently got problems broken down into small steps, and I consistently was able to break apart WHAT I wanted to to do from HOW I wanted to do it - but when I got to the how, I did not always know how to implement my chosen tool that would get the job done. I even got to a point where I would CONSISTENTLY reach for the RIGHT tool-but putting it in the right place/etc took a lot o time. I learned that pry is my bff, and that I need to push myself out of my comfort zone when I am practicing my exercises and use the new tools that have been introduced. I also struggled with mindset-I came into programming with a mindset that there must be VERY set rules, and that hindered me a lot-I learned that 99.999999% of programming is pure opinion, and that if I think that something is a rule (i.e. nested enumerables are not allowed), I need to IMMEDIATELY check that assumption with an instructor, or it will really bite me later on. I also REALLY struggled with timed assessments when I was at school taking them. The last two, I had full blown panic attacks in the middle of them due to picking up the nervousness and anxiety of all the people around me, but when I took them at home, that was not even a factor. I absolutely believe that if I was able to do the timed assessments in a study room, I would perform much better and consistently score three or higher.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I *loved* BLACK THURSDAY! loved loved LOVED this project! I could do SO many things with it and I kicked MAJOR ass on writing super complicated methods/making modules/having classes talk to each other etc. My partner kept telling me I was a genius-ha! It was so logical and it was like an all you can eat sweet buffet for my brain. I loved it. Even though we did not finish, I'm confident that with literally 2-3 more hours of concentrated effort I could get it working and looking great.

Least favorite was enigma. The pairing was really terrible and it was a bad experience. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that finishing is *not the biggest deal in the world*, but that pushing yourself to get out of your comfort zone in your exercises can be really useful in your project. I also learned much better how to make things scalable. I also learned that getting help from fellow students is 100% ok, but at the end of the day, its my decision on what to do.  I also learned how to ask more specific questions of fellow students/teachers when I was stuck, and the process of getting help improved dramatically.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
oof. oh boy.
Well. Ok. I learned that you can't control the actions of other other people, and that speaking your mind is absolutely necessary when you see a problem right off the bat. I learned that I need to listen to what my partner has to tell me and learn how to trust on good faith that what they are saying might just work, even if I dont fully understand it. I also learned that messing around with your partner in pry is great!

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

This module, I've distinguished myself as a powerful student advocate.

For example, I became an advocate and organizer for solving a fundamental problem with the Learn and Earn program. 14 students were impacted, and I advocated for each student's academic and financial future with key stakeholders both at Turing and with Learn and Earn. This led to the implementation of sustainable short and long term solutions for every student, the Learn and Earn organization, and Turing.


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would be very much interested in contributing to career development of my fellow classmates, including not only encouraging and leading events that include landing a job (aka networking/meetups/etc), but also finding and presenting resources for student for after they *LAND* the job (aka, how to negotiate a salary raise including practicing with staff, lightning pairings where you and a partner have to solve a challenge together in half an hour to increase the efficiency of pairing on work projects, etc)
