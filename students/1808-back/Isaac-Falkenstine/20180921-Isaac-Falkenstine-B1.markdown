## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
-I set out to gain a stronger understanding of ruby and to build a foundation
for a career in software development. I definitely feel like I met those goals.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
-I struggled most with the independent projects, and the motivation to work hard
everyday. As in high school (especially senior year), I had the weekends to myself
and didn't have to work that hard after school days. Which has made Turing a huge
adjustment for me. I've learned that if I want to do well I can't afford to take
whole days to rest and I really need to work hard everyday.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
-My favorite project was Enigma because it actually had a historical background
which made it really cool and interesting to do.
-My least favorite was Battleship because I believe that it was a lot harder than
all of the other projects considering our knowledge of Ruby at the time of working
on it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
-I learned a lot about how the work flow of Turing will be during my time here
and how I could be more successful for future projects. In addition I learned a lot
about how I work in general.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
-The biggest thing I learned from the paired projects is how to work with a partner
in a successful manner. I came into this Mod, rarely working in groups, and now I
have over 3 weeks of experience, working on very challenging problems with another
person.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
-I contributed to the Turing community by trying to be a helpful person whenever
I could. In addition to being helpful, I also tried my hardest to just be a kind,
and thoughtful person. Being a ass helps no one, so I tried to not be a ass.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
-Now that I have all of the knowledge that I do, I want to be able to help the
new students with their work just like the 1806 students did for us.
