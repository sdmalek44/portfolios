## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  I set out to learn the basics of Ruby language and understand the core tenets of Ruby back-end coding. I also made it a point to try to engage, actively, with both my classmates and the larger coding community. I feel that I was successful on all counts.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I still struggle a bit with #inject! I also had some trouble grasping encapsulation but feel I learned the most about both of these during the time I was paired with William for the "black thursday" project. I also learned a great deal, in the process, about how to seek and find information for myself, online, as well as how to approach other students, and my mentor, about specific questions.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  I cannot say enough about what a positive experience it has been to work with William on the "black thursday" project. That has been my favorite, because I learned so much in the process. I did not have a great time with "battleship", probably because it was complex and working alone on it made it harder to bounce ideas off of classmates, many of whom approached it completely differently that I did.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  I learned how to rely on myself and trust my own design intuitions, relying on the knowledge instilled in me during this first mod. The difficulties and subsequent successes or failures has really helped my confidence in breaking into a field that is quite outside my historical comfort zone. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  I learned so much during both paired projects. The "enigma" project taught me the value of the techniques Turing has taught us regarding how to work in a team and how to maintain productive energy, using techniques like the Pomodoro.
  The "black thursday" project taught me an incredible amount about good design and scalability, because I was so fortunate to work with a partner who is gifted in these respects and who helped me to understand how to write scalable code from the jump, instead of relying on subsequent refactoring.  

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I feel I have made myself pro-actively available as a resource to my peers, and have tried to maintain a positive, approachable energy throughout. I am so grateful to be a part of this community and hope to continue making a positive contribution thereto.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I want to continue to develop the relationships that have begun this mod, as well as to provide a ready resource to incoming mod-1 students. I really can't wait to help them learn the basics we have learned this mod!
