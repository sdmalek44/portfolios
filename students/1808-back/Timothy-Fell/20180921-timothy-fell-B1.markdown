# Timothy Fell - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to learn the basics of OOP and specifically Ruby. I feel I've been successful but there are a few areas I want to continue to work on. Namely, testing, optimizing code, class interactions (using one classes class methods in conjunction with another class).

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled the most with class interactions. The idea of bridging the gaps between files and classes within your code took me a while to wrap my head around. Learning how to do this has reinforced my understanding of scope and expanded the possibilities of what I can create immensely.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project this module was Black Thursday. It was long, some of the methods were complicated but I think for me it reinforced my class interaction skills, made me confront optimization issues and how to divide the work to complete the project on time.

My least favorite project was Battleship. I was paralyzed by choice on what classes to make and not really understanding class interaction going into the project made it nearly impossible for me to work through it without external intervention.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
When, during my coding process, to ask for help and what to ask for help with.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
Working with other people without good division and organization of the work to be done is hard.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I washed dishes? I felt like I was barely keeping my head above water with the work and struggled to find enough sleep throughout the rest of the module that I never felt like I had time to go to any none class or project related events. I tried my best every opportunity I had to give useful feedback but for the lightning talks there was never enough time to write anything useful before the next presenter started and by the end I couldn't remember peoples names or topics so I couldn't expand on my feedback.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Pair with backend mod 1 students. Attend more of the code fairs, demo nights and networking events with industry professionals. Write down feedback notes during presentations to write out more useful feedback later for lightning talks.
