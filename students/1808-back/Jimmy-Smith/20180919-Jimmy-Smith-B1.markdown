# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
My goal for this module is very broad, and that was to get an overall knowledge of everything
that would be taught to me and to comfortably use them.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Writing Algorithms. When seeing an algorithm, I try my best to process them and usually end up wasting
time where I should be asking for help. You can struggle alone but you always have resources that can
pull you from that struggle and the best resource for me has been paired programming.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project this module was Black Thursday. Although complex and very challenging, I feel like I learned
alot from this project. It strengthened my knowledge on enumerables and how objects talk to each other. My
least favorite project would have to be battleship due to my migraines impacting my overall progress on it.
Also the fact that you really had to think outside the box to really implement code for the project.


What did you learn from your independent projects?
What I learned from independent projects is you definitely have to set time aside in advance, set goals
and adhere to those goals. And ask for help when you spend over 20 minutes on a problem.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
What I learned from the paired projects is an increase in my communication skills. I told my partner
what I wanted and how I would achieve that. Of course, I was not over bearing because to have a partnership you
must be able to conform to the demands of your partner. Overall communication skills.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I contributed to the Turing community an ear for people to talk to. Whatever troubles,
praises, complaints people had. I was there to listen.
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Positivity and knowledge that people can gain from.
