## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

To learn as much about coding as I could. I feel very comfortable coding in Ruby now
so I think that I did accomplish this goal. I remember doing problems on Free Code
Camp and struggling to write the algorithms they wanted. Now with enumrables I
think I could do a lot of those challenges much easier now.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I often felt overwhelmed with all the material. Sometimes I would feel the urge to freeze
when that pressure hit. I was more successful when I didn't focus on all that I
needed to learn but instead focused on the problem at hand. Just like programming
it can be beneficial to break your problems down into smaller manageable problems.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Battleship was my favorite. I felt it involved the most problem solving and puzzles.
Enigma was also a lot of fun.

Sorting Cards was my least favorite. I think I disliked it at the time because
I was still getting familiar with OOP and mini tests. I think if I were to redo
the project it would be a piece of cake now.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

With sorting cards OOP finally clicked. Even though Battleship went well I came up
with ideas on how I could have done it better.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I became more familiar with using helper methods. I also learned how to use
github to work share.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I tried to help fellow students whenever I could. The problem for me helping was
I often didn't feel confident enough in the material to offer my help. I also
joined a posse. I'd like to continue to be active in it.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'd like to be able to help my peers more. Hopefully I can help the new students
next mod as I will be confident with the material they are learning.
