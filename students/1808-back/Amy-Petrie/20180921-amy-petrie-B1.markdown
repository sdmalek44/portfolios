# Amy Petrie - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Coming into Turing, I set out to hit the ground running, and keep running all the
way through. I knew the material would be new and challenging, but I wanted to
end the module knowing I gave 100% every day so that I could say I did my best,
no matter how things go. I definitely feel like I've been successful, and am walking
away from this mod with a wealth of new knowledge and skills that were non-existant
six weeks ago. I feel very proud of the work and effort I've put in, and am very
satisfied with where I'm at.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled with anxiety of feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work, particularly
thinking that I wouldn't be able to finish one or two of the projects during the
given timelines. I set high expectations for myself, and can become prematurely
disheartened due to stress, making myself my own worst enemy. However, I persevered
during those times throughout the mod, and feel like I've come out stronger than
ever before after conquering the intellectual and emotional challenges.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects were also my least favorite - Battleship and Black Thursday.
They were my least favorite because they caused me to struggle new and challenging
ways, and although I was expecting the struggle, it didnt make it any easier. However,
I feel like I made many mistakes throughout architecting both projects that taught
me the most out of everything we did in the mod. Working on these difficult projects,
making mistakes, correcting them and learning from them is what really cemented
down  some of the fundamental aspects of OOP for me, and those moments of having
things click was well worth it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I really enjoy independent work, but learned I should be quicker to ask for help when
needed. I like to struggle through problems and reach my own conclusions because
by asking for help earlier as needed.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

It was reinforced to me that other people have very different learning styles, and
I need to continue getting comfortable working with different types of workers.
I learned that paired projects have an extra layer of difficulty in that you aren't
in complete control of the project, but a contributor, and also that few things
are more important than clear and consistent communication.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I tried to be as social as I felt I could manage with the Turing community. I think
I really bonded with some members of my cohort, and really enjoy building camaraderie with my classmates. I continually to position myself as someone approachable and kind to
those around me, since I truly believe we're in this together.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I think I'd like to perhaps get involved in a posse, but haven't had one particularly
peak my interest yet (in a way where I would prioritize it over working on a project
or having a few minutes of free time).
