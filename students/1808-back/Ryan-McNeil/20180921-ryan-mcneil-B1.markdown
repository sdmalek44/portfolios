## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- This module was meant to be a refresher for me and get me back in "learning" mode.
  I would say I was successful.  Although there were very few things in the lectures
  that were new to me (besides Ruby-Specific things), I was fuzzy on several of the topics.
  Coming into the final assessments, I felt strong, and I'm confident I'm back in
  the zone.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- Turing/Life management was one of my biggest struggles, but I did it too myself. I over
  committed myself prior to Turing for Mod1, and it made it harder to get things
  done at a comfortable pace.  I felt myself having to cram things in, stay up late,
  miss workouts/meal planning, etc.  I've learned that I shouldn't do that (clearly).
  I'll be better about keeping weekends open for work time, and give myself
  "me time" when necessary.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- I think Black Thursday was my favorite.  It was great practice for everything
  for everything we've learned this mod, and I enjoyed the problem solving
  involved in determining which data sets were the best to iterate through to find
  what you were looking for.  I think my least favorite was complete_me. For some
  reason, I couldn't quite understand what was going on.  When it did click,
  it was a sprint to get it done in time.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- I've learned it's ok to ask questions.  I generally work well on my own, and
  I generally have a better greater understanding afterwards, but I know that
  sometimes I need to "rubber duck".  So many times I'd be staring at my screen,
  but as soon as I turned away and tried to verbalize my issue, I'd figure it out.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
- I've learned it's very important for partners to be on the same page with
  regards to understanding where the project is going.  If they are not, and
  gaining that understanding is not a priority, time can be lost due to inefficiency.
  Personally, I know that I need to figure something out for myself, and not rely
  on someone explaining it to.  I know I need to read things, and sometimes read
  it a few times, to gain a good foundation before moving on.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I wasn't very active in the community this mod to be honest.  A few of us tried
  the health and fitness posse week 1, but never went back due to "time". However,
  I feel like I'm one of the guys in my mod that people know they can go to for help
  or to chat.  I always try to be smiling!

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- I'd like to get involved in a posse or 2.  A few of us may even start a lunch time
running posse!
