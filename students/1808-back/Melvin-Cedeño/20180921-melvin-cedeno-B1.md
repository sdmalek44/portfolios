# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

To be able to explain what I learned last mod, to the new folks. I liked being able to do CompleteMe, it was nice having the option, felt like I had plenty of opportunity to challenge myself early on which was great. I don't do well with boredom, and at first I was worried I was gonna be bored the first couple weeks but alas that did not occur.
