# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  Being able to understand the basic principles of ruby and the interaction with other tools.
  I think I was successful in learning the basic stuff.I am not as great as I wanted to be, but it's a start, I've doing this for only 6 weeks.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I struggled the most with the mechanics of ruby, and figuring out exactly what I need to do to in certain situation.  I learned a lot about being patient, the fact that I don't have tech background has created a gap between what I need to do and what I know.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite was Black Thursday, I really enjoyed working with my partner, we decided not to rush the project and try to understand what we were doing, even if that meant that we had to sacrifice part of the project, which in the end, we did. But I was happy with the result, not because it was a great work, but because we were able to understand everything or most of what we did. We asked a lot of help and we were out of our comfort zone several times, but it was a great learning process.
  In the other hand, my least favorite project was enigma, exactly because of the opposite reasons. I felt that my partner was rushing the project trying to have control of all the situation, sometimes without even consulting with me. We were supposed to be a team. But imn the end I felt like I was working for him, not with him. But, again, it was a great learning process. Learned a lot of working as a team and that helped me to be aware of the things that you shouldn't do as a partner.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  I learned that when it comes to work under pressure, specifically time-periods, I need to work faster, not like rush myself. Just try to be more aware of my time.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned so much about GitHub and about the things that you should not do working with others.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I'll volunteer for an event where Turing will take part next weekend. Just providing info about our school to latino prospects students.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would love to be able to help more people next module. I'll do my best to acquire more knowledge for the module, so I can share it with more people and not being asking so many questions. I'd love to be able one of the code producer's and not only a consumer.
