# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  1. This is my first experience learning in a different language, is hard to say how successful because I'm steel struggling, and I have a ton to learn, specially with my writing skills. I acquire a good basis to keep building upon and consider that success.

  2. Face struggle I think is one of the biggest knowledges I acquire from this mod. Never easy to predict how you are going to respond under pressure but the firsts week of the mod I have to develop techniques to make it more manageable. And realize that I can apply this into my on life.

  3. Have a deeper understanding of ruby mechanics and data types, as an new tool for problem solving. What is something that I really care about. I came to Turing with some knowledge of coding and them realize at the beginning of week two I learned more then I previously know about it.

  Overall I feel successful with what I learned in the mod. I  can identify the areas that I need to work harder, like my language skills and taking better care of myself

### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  Probably was learning in English, go back and reread lessons, make miss spell that break my code, have a hard time to write a feedback or CFUs. I learned how to overcome this disadvantage to certain point, I know that there is a lot of room for improvement, but with practice I have the confidence that I can make them go away.
## Projects

### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  Black Thursday was the sum of my struggles. I didn't have clear expectations on the project, that plus personal problems, pushing myself to complete it without a partner and the lack of sleep because of it. But also look in perspective a feel proud for what I learned from the experience, now I have the basis to build a smart (cain off) data base from scratch, learned a ton of new method for my toolbox, be more organize on my coding and designing but also in my life.

### What did you learn from your independent projects?
  Learned to seek for my resources when I'm stuck, but also thinks outside the box when designing.

### What did you learn from your paired projects?
  To work as a team, I done it before but in this level, active listening was a great part of my learning by pair, but also be able to defend my ideas was another part.

## Community

### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  From day one Turing community receive me with open arms and that by it own led me be more open to share my experiences. I try to help anyone who reach me on slack, or in person to discuss personal or class related problems.

### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I'm thinking on start writing some of my experience in some sort of blog. This is an idea that I have been working for a long time ago but I never felted that someone would be interested in what I have to say till now. My experience in the community has encourage me to rethink it.
