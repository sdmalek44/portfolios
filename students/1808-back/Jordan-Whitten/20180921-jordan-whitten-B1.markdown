# Jordan Whitten - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I set out to finish this module having gained a strong understanding of ruby
and coding principles as well as learn as much as possible. I worked hard coding
everyday and I do believe I've accomplished my goal.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I struggled the most with the occasional problems that would keep my code from
working, properly, but I found that solving these problems was very rewarding
and that coding seems to be a great choice of career for me.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  My favorite project this module was Complete Me. Complete Me offered many novel
learning experiences and exciting concepts with great future potential. The group
I did the project with was also very harmonious and productive providing a great
working experience.
  My least favorite project was Black Thursday. My partner and I didn't seem to see
eye to eye on a few things and the project offered a lot of repetition and not many
new concepts. We didn't work at a fast enough pace when together, so I needed to push
the pace on my own to ensure we finished on time.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I steadily improved my problem solving abilities and understanding of Ruby by
consistently persevering on my projects and associated problems.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  Paired projects helped me to get more acquainted with working on a team or in a
pair which is a weak point for me.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I contributed in my own small way by learning to socialize with my peers and
making new friends to help break me out of my shell.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  If time permits, I'd like to join to the machine learning posse. I'm generally
very busy with learning and working on projects, so I don't find much time to
Participate in extracurriculars other than to go out with friends once a week.
