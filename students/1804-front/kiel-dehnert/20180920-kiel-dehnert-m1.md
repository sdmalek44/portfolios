## Individual Goals for the Module

Redux was by far the technology that I was most interested in this module. I really wanted to get a solid working knowledge of the moving pieces so I was able to impliment it into my projects early and follow the process of getting data into the store really quickly and easily.  I had a decent working knowledge of React coming into the mod, but I also wanted to solidify that knowledge and get comfortable using that technology.  I didn't know what router was so honestly I kind of glossed over that one until the personal project, but now that I've used it I realize how simple yet powerful of a tool it can be. On a personal level, I knew there would be a lot of hours I would have to throw into this, so I wanted to create early habits of staying at school late, and making sure I was putting as much time as I needed to into this mod.

## Individual Self Assessment

I am really happy with were I am. React and redux are both second nature to me at this point, and I feel incredibly comfortable making my way around the technologies that we have learned over the course of this mod. Even router, which as I mentioned before I wasn't focusing on, has really clicked well. I feel comfortable utilizing it as well.  there is certainly plenty to work on to stay on top of everything though. I can definitely do async testing, but it definitely doesn't flow as quickly or smoothly as the rest of the code we have gone over. I'd like to focus on that during the break as well as dive into angular to learn a different framework.  As far as the personnal goes, I do honestly think I need to find a better balance between my social life and Turing. Obviously you have to throw your all into the your studies to get through such a accelerated program, but I defintely felt burnt out by the end. I could have made the last project better and still plan to once I have given myself a moment to breathe. All in all though, I definitely set out to do what I intended to do and I have a firm grasp on all of the technologies provided to me. I feel incredibly confident and prepared moving forward into mod 4.

## A summary of how you've contributed to the community

 I have been solid as always as far as pairing goes. All of the mod 2 folk know that they can always come to me for help.  I have always and will continue to help the mods below me. It is invaluable to have that kind of resource coming through the program, and I am happy to always be there for them.  Also did an ironFE session to make sure they were understanding the prototype methods.  As always, I've recommended Turing to many friends across the U.S. and I think several will be starting within the next few cohorts.
