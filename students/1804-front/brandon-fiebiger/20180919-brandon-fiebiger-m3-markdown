#### Beers In Town

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brandonfiebiger/beers-in-town)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This project was very fun. The goal of this project was to take my given targeted audience, api and technology and create an application. My target audience was craft-beer enthisiasts, my api was the Meetup API and my technology was geo-location. I created an app that takes the users location and displays for them craft-beer related events, breweries and groups withing a 100 mile radius of them. The user can also search a city and state to find cool craft beer events.
