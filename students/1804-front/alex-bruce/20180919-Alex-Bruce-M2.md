## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/CompleteMe)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me introduces data structures, and mainly focuses on prefix tries. It's a project that gets deeper into true computer science concepts than had been seen before in the Front-End program.

Evaluation score: Pass


#### (Game-Time)

* [GitHub]()
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game-Time's purpose is mainly to teach the basics of object oriented JacaScript and ES6, with an emphasis on classes and how they can be manipulated, with an additional visual aspect, being HTML canvas.

Evaluation scores: Pass


## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (World Citizen)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/30ozSteak/AB-ND-World-Citizen)

World Citizen was a project I chose to do instead of Weathrly this time. I worked with Nick DAmbrosio in building a front-end mobile application based on the  Rails project created by Justine Troyke. This reestablished my understanding of the way React works, and gave me a deeper understanding than I had previously had of the way it mechanically works. We implemented components with state, props, lifecycle methods, and other things used in React, as well as other Javascript concepts, like manipulating localStorage.

Evaluation Scores: Pass
