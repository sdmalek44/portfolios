A summary of how you've contributed to the community

## Areas of Emphasis & Goals for the Module

My areas of emphasis this module were to sharpen my React skills, gain a deep understanding of Redux and utilize my Array Prototype knowledge in order to succeed throughout this mod. I also wanted to start making an effort to network more with external resources so that I have a higher chance of landing a quality job as soon as possible after my Turing career.

#### Personal Project / Orbital

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/orbital)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/red-green-blue.html)

My personal project was built for high school students with the goal of making the application a mobile-first application. This application utilized Hubblesite's RESTful API to generate both a review section for users to review space content as well as a trivia section for users to test their space knowledge.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My Group Projects this mod included SWAPIbox and MovieTracker.

#### SWAPIbox

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/swapibox)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

In this project, my partner and I built an application that used SWAPI's API to display a variety of information about various people, planets and vehicles from Star Wars. Users can add their favorite items to their favorites as well as enjoy a loading screen of Han Solo while they are waiting patiently for their information to display.

#### MovieTracker

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/movie-tracker)
- [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

For this project, Brandon, Jesse and I built an application focusing on displaying movies that included Bill Murray in them. Our overall design was similar to that of Netflix's homepage and allowed the user to log in, add favorite and click on a particular movie in order to view a synposis of that specific movie as well as a release date pertaining to that movie and its rating.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This module, I didn't pair with as many students as I did in mod 2, but I made sure to make an effort to help other students with issues they were having, whether that be related to Array Prototypes, Game Time, or any other projects. I also put my self out there for students in Mod 1 that needed help as well.
