# Chris Boylen - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this module were to solidify my understanding of React/Redux/Router, asynchronous testing, improve my solving problem process, and improve my communication skills working in a team environment. I feel as though I have improved in all of these areas, especially testing.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

### Headcount 2.0
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chrisboylen/headcount2.0.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
* **Fundamental JS and Style:** 3
* **Testing:** 3
* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3
* **Functional Expectations:** 4
* **Code Sanitation:** 3

Headcount 2.0 is a ReactJS app that imports school district data and displays that data in a digestable way. This app allows a user to search for a specific district and to compare the data of two districts.

### Meetup Matcher
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chrisboylen/meetup-matcher-front.git)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/red-green-blue.html)

Meetup Matcher is working off The Meetup API. The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and enter a city and state location. Then recieve a list of meetups for that location based on user preferences. Using Firebase realtime database as a backend, I set up a separate client-side application using create-react-app.

## B: Group Work & Projects

My group work throughout the module strengthened my collaboration, communication, leadership and problem solving skills.  I enjoyed all the partners that I had throughout the module and think that my group projects went well.  I plan to continue to strengthen my collaboration, communication, leadership and problem solving skills moving forward.

### SWAPI Box
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chrisboylen/SwapiBox.git)

SWAPI Box uses the Star Wars API to display information about the people, planets, and vehicles from the Star Wars franchise. A user can add/remove favorites and view them in the favorites tab. 

### Movie Tracker

This project is working off the The Movie DB API. The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Using Postgres as a backend, we set up a separate client-side application (use create-react-app), to sit alongside this one.

## C: Professional Skills
* **[Turing Profile](https://alumni.turing.io/alumni/chris-boylen)**

## E: Community Participation
This session, I contributed to the community by pairing with Mod 2 students. These activities help solidify my own understanding of programming concepts and I love the community it promotes between mods. I hope to continue working collaboratively with my own classmates and the mods below me. 

## Final Assessment

Moving forward I plan to improve my problem solving process, communication and organization skills.  I look forward to improving my understanding and implementing databases, testing and working more efficiently with others. Over intermission I plan to spend more time with React while enjoying time with my family, while still maintaining healthy eating, sleeping, exercising, and studying habits.
