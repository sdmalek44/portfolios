# Gray Smith - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I have been excited for mod3 since I started at Turing. Going into mod3 I knew I wanted to solidify my ability to conceptualize an idea and be able to think through it thoroughly and build out an MVP product. I feel like I am becoming much more confident in my ability to create things from scratch and implement my own original ideas rather than just following guides.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first individual project, Head Count, was a good introduction to working with datasets and turning them into a single page application using react. The second individual project, BeakSeeker, was by far my favorite. I thoroughly enjoyed wireframing and building out my own idea.

#### Head Count 2.0

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GraySmith00/gs-headCount2.0)
- [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Head Count 2.0 was a good introduction to working with larger data sets and refining them down to what was needed in the application. It was also a nice refresher on working in React and manipulating the UI in different ways depending on how we wanted the data to be displayed.

#### BeakSeeker

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GraySmith00/beak-seeker-client)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/red-green-blue.html)

BeakSeeker is the most fun way to go birding! Find the best local hotspots. See which birds have been recently seen in your area. Earn badges for spotting birds and compete against your fellow birders to see who is the ultimate beak seeker! I learned a ton building this app. Taking a basic idea, wireframing, and then turning it into an MVP was a great experience. I plan to work further on this app by building out the Leaderboard, Badges, and many other features.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### SW-api Box

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GraySmith00/gs-ml-swapibox)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SW-api Box was a fun project and a great refresher in working with an API that had a lot of data. We put a lot of effort into the design of our app and making it look as clean and beautiful as possible. This project was also a great refresher on testing a react App with Enzyme and Jest. I have referred back to the testing on this application many times.

#### Movie Tracker

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GraySmith00/movie-tracker-client)
- [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie tracker is an app that can be used for viewing the most recently released movies along with their ratings and trailers. Users can also favorite movies that they plan on seeing. This project was a good exercise in working in a larger group and using the rebase git workflow. This was also a great introduction to using Redux and testing React / Redux applications.

## D: Community Participation

I've done my best to give back to the Turing community by donating my time and trying to inspire those around me. I've led Iron FE once a week throughout the entire mod and have tried to lend and extra hand to those that may be lagging behind. I also participated in top talks and shared all my favorite extra learning resources with the school.

### Playing a Part

I have tried to be a driving force in the learning of everyone around me at Turing. I have spent countless hours pairing with peaple in Mod1, helping them with their projects and instilling good fundementals and problem solving skills. I have participated in the community as much as my free time will allow me to. I've attended the last 5 or 6 demo nights to support my classmates and see what they have been working on. I also try to attend as many meetups as possible and always speak very highly of Turing.
