# Benjamin Paige - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this mod were to strengthen my React fundamentals, gain a working knowledge of Redux, improve on using TDD - especially testing async JavaScript. I feel that I accomplished my goals and feel I have a better understanding of testing.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### SWAPI-Box

* [SWAPI-Box](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)


SWAPI Box uses the Star Wars API to display information about the people, planets, and vehicles from the Star Wars franchise. A user can add/remove favorites and view them in the favorites tab.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

#### MovieTracker

* [Sh**ty Sci-fi](https://github.com/benjaminpaige/movietracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Ever have trouble picking your favorite bad sci-fi movie? Sh**ty Sci-fi is a dynamic application that allows a user to see a list of the worst (thus... best) sci-fi movies and a summary of each movie, built with React, Router and Redux. The user can create an account and add movies to a favorites page, which the user can reference whenever they need to pick a movie to watch!

### Playing a Part

I lead one third of the Iron FE sessions to help the mod2ers with array prototypes, was active in pairing with mod2 and mod1, and supplied the kitchen with enough flatware to equip a small army.
