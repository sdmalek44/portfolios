# Tim Fischer - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This Mod I focused on areas of emphasis that would assist me in feeling technically prepared in a professional setting. While I would in no way consider myself an expert in any area specifically, I have learned to embrace what I felt were my bigger weaknesses and I now feel that I have grown the most in my self teaching abilities.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing A Part

Despite staying very preoccupied with my own personal work this mod I made an effort to reach out to Mod 2 students to assist them with their work. Between leading Iron FE and pairing with them on their projects I wanted to make myself accessible to them, as I recall how challenging some of the new material is in Mod 2. I also assisted in multiple Try Coding weekends as I recalled how that was the biggest encouragement to my desire to attend Turing. I try to express that same enthusiasm to potential students.
