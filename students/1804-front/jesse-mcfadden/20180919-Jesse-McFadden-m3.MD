# Jesse  - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I focused primarily on honing my React skills while adding Redux and Router to the mix. I thoroughly enjoyed my projects, but paired and solo. This was a great opportunity for me to use all of the skills I have gained so far to see what I could do.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### HeadCount 2.0
[Github] https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/headcount2.0

Headcount was a good way to start the mod. It caused us all to jump back into the thick of data manipulation. 

### Represent
[Github] https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/represented

This was my first self-directed(ish) solo project. It was a huge learning opportunity and I am really happy with how it turned out. The integration of the API and PDF NPM module went way smoother than I had anticipated. My struggle(as usual) was in the testing. In the end, I managed to learn a lot about how Redux and Router work while also developing my testing skills.

## C: Group Work & Projects


### Movie-Tracker
[Github] https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/movie-tracker

Movie Tracker was my favorite project. Working with Kurt and Brandon was fantastic. We all rounded each other out well and got through the interations quickly. Brandon taught me a lot about testing, Kurt was great at CSS and keeping us on track.


### HeadCount 2.0
[GitHub Repo] (https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/swapi-box-jj)

I really enjoyed working with Joel on Swapi box. It was one of the first projects where I felt like I could truly demonstrate my ability to manipulate data. The testing aspect was a struggle, but I learned a lot and we managed to gain a lot of coverage in a short amount of time.
