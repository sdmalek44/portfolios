## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

My biggest achievement of Mod-4 was being able to complete all of the course work.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

The biggest struggle by far was doing the course work combined with the job search. I don't feel was able to submit work to the
standard I would have liked to. I learned not to spread my self in to to many directions.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I don't believe I have really done any thing to set my self apart from my peers. This by far felt like my worst inning at Turing.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I have a goal of working as "Full-Stack" engineer. I understand that as an engineer I may not be able to fully understand all the intricacies of both sides of the engineering stack. But I would like to be strong in Front-End and have enough understanding to build/grasp all the moving parts of a stack. It was great to learn more about different technologies that I have not yet used such as knex and have a better understand of relational databases. I feel this mod helped reinforce the goal I have to work on both sides of the stack.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

I feel the most important skill I will walk away with from Turing is an improved method for learning.
