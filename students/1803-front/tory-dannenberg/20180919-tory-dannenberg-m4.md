## Reflections

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Honestly for me I think it was just surviving the experience. Turing is an incredible grind, and staying mentally focused and engaged with the finish line so close can be a challenge, especially when you are getting thrown a new language or technology to try to learn almost daily. I am incredibly proud of myself and my cohort-mates for everything we have accomplished throughout Turing, not just in mod4. I also cherish the relationships that I have built and look forward to having a new group of life-long friends (and connections)! 
And keeping EYFF going throughout the mod… 

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
The biggest struggle in mod4 was staying focused and engaged on the challenging workload, while also dealing with the distraction and mounting pressure of trying to find a job. I learned that if you just keep focusing on the present and the obstacle directly in front of you without letting the future stress you out you will end up being much more productive. 

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
This was not my most successful mod at Turing and had a few external distractions that prevented me from excelling as much as I wanted to but all things considered I am extremely proud of my work during mod4. I love my cohort, we got along incredibly well and helped each other through a lot of tough challenges. Each person stands out in their own way, and I think I stood out by just being myself, trying to stay positive and injecting humor whenever to keep other people positive during the tough days.  


* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I really enjoyed being forced outside of my comfort zone in this mod, but I think more than anything it reinforced my love for the Front End. It certainly is a different line of thinking in the Back End, and it was an extremely valuable experience to learn some of their technologies and see things from the other side. I would definitely love to be full stack sometime in the near future, but for now I could not be more happy with my decision to do the Front End program. I might not have the best design skills, but I love the creativity that the front end allows you to have. 


* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Confidence. In so many different ways Turing has inspired confidence. There were certainly many low points, but from the get go Turing instilled the growth mindset and the belief that it wasn’t a matter of if I figured something out, but when. As long as you put in the work and believe in yourself, you can figure (pretty much) anything out. Mod1 you are spoon fed almost every answer, but as you progress it becomes more and more about learning how to find the resources to solve problems on your own, which is an invaluable skill going forward.
