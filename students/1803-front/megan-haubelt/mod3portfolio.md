## Individual Goals for the Module

My individual goals for the module were to get more comfortable with React and just become quicker at writing code.  I think I succeeded at both but still need more reps. 

## Individual Self-Assessment
The pace of this mod was intense and overwhelming for me, and I had some personal challenges outside of Turing.  Once Redux was introduced, I felt that I fell behind of where I needed to be with my learning.  I plan to use the break to get lots of reps in with Redux.

## Final Assessment
Retake mod3

## Included Projects 
[HeadCount 2.0] (https://github.com/Haub/headcount2.0)
HeadCount was a good introduction to mod3 and helped solidify key concepts in React.  It was also a good chance to see where I was at with React since it was a solo project.

[SWAPIbox] (https://github.com/Haub/swapibox) 
I enjoyed doing SWAPIbox and it was a valuable learning experience to make multiple fetch calls to the api.  

[MovieTracker](https://github.com/tomkingkong/movie-tracker) 
MovieTracker was the first Turing project working with Redux and with a team of 3.  Even though we mostly worked together in person, it was probably more realistic of a real world work environment.  It was also a good learning experience to implement a back-end.

## Contributions to the Community 
I would love to do more this next mod.  I had a hard enough time just keeping up and with personal responsibilities outside of Turing.  I try to answer questions from classmates and students in other mods when available.
