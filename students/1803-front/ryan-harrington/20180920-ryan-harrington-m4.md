# What was your biggest achievement of the module?

Biggest Achievement of the mod was by far learning to build servers in Node and Express. 
This really helped round out my understanding of the entire process. I came to Turing with truly NO experience, no background, nothing.  This gave me a lot of context to understand other things. Talking with backend students who would talk about "spinning up servers", "tables", etc. I really had no idea what they were talking about. I could generally regurgitate what I've heard at the water cooler, but my knowledge certainly couldn't have survived any probing questions.

# What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

The eval, to my surprise again. Which was a reminder that I don't just understand things from seeing them once. I can look at it, while workign on a project, and fumble my way to the finish line.  However, I don't really understand it until I sit down on my own out of class, without a partner and go through a thing.  Poke it, see what I've got, poke it again. What do I have?  Without the confidence in my understanding of a concept, I have a hard time getting off the ground. Once I have a little momentum, can see where I'm heading, I can cruise.  If I loosely understand something from blindly following steps or a partner pointing things out in the setup then putting my own logic in, I can struggle. In summary, seeing a thing is not the same as doing a thing for me. I'm a hands on learner and need to remember that.

That combined with having taken a long laborday weekend completely off to go to a wedding didn't help. I fell behind on some work and ultimately never did any job hunting activities because I was playing catch up on school work. 

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

The first half of the mod I was dilligent about working on codewars. I've been working on Exercisms and look forward to working on Project Euler problems. I think doing some of the coding challenges with Ian helped me narrow down my jobsearch. I enjoy the algorithmic problem solving which makes sense because I like incorporating math in my code. An example, was in mod2 on GameTime I really enjoyed working on the collision detection of my game, Tron. Figuring out the best way to do check, if you hit yourself, the wall, opponent, all without crashing right off the bat.

# How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

Learning about the backend opened up my eyes to the forest. I'd just been seeing trees. Focusing intently on one thing at a time it's easy to miss the bigger picture. Whether it's JS testing like mythical creatures in mod1, array prototypes in mod2, react in mod3, or backend in mod4. Things get rusty, fortunately it's easy to find solutions you once knew. But getting to see the backend was good because to me, everything started at the JSON object that I saw in postman before this. I drop my url in there, call the fetch, and cool the stuff I wanted is there.  I don't know how it got there, it's just there.  Learning about the backend cleared up some of the fog. 

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Knowing how I learn. I can memorize information easily. I've got specific memories, movie references, you name it from hearing something once years ago. Taking concepts and applying them to different scenarios, is not something I will do well if I'm sitting on the sidelines. I have to be on the keyboard. Doing it myself, or I need to go back through it after because obviously I have to be fair to my teammate. I'm not the only person who will want to be on the keyboard. It's important for me to keep in mind that sitting there watching it, even if it's exactly what I'd type, the concepts just will not stick as well if I don't go back and do it myself. "It looks easy, it makes sense, no problem." Doesnt matter, to make it stick, for me, I need to be the one doing it. Once I've got it, I can teach it, pass up the reigns, but until then I need to be on it, or go back on my own.
