# What was your biggest achievement of the module?
In all honesty graduating is a huge deal to me. I could have never imagined how hard this program would be on the mind and body.
Turing is by far the hardest thing that I have ever done. Unlike college, at Turing you must actually lean the material and be able
to implement it in real life ways. I completely underestimated how taxing it would really and how much it would test every aspect of
my day to day life. Turing has helped me become a better smarter person and I am thankful for that.
  
# What provided you with the most struggle?
In mod 4 senoritis provided the most struggle in terms of lose due dates and zero project evals.
## What did you learn from that struggle?
What I learned most from the struggle is that I do best with a set deadline meaning if given 6 months I will take 6 months, given 5 days I will take 5 days to complete a project.
I have also learned that I'm more of a "second half" of the game type of person.

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I have set myself apart by utlizing React Native in my capstone as I am very interested in mobile app development. 

# How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing?
I'm definately more interested in full stack development at this point and confident that I can learn Ruby or Python enough to work on a full stack team.
## How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
Learning something about the other side makes it easier to understand what you need to do in order to work together effectively and
understand what realistic expectaions are and should be.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
The ability to learn the baisics of something in a very small amount of time and start implementing it immediately.
