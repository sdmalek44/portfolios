# Module 4 Portfolio Presentation

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I stood up for myself in the capstone.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
August is a terrible month for me. 

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I stayed in contact with other mods and people who have left Turing.  I paired effectively with my mentor.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? 
I knew before that I was interested in developing back end skills. Creating baby servers in Mod4 and learning some sql commands was interesting and will eventually be useful in a job.

* How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
The 'shortcuts' that backenders are taught for styling are very appealing.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
I think the most marketable libraries/frameworks that I learned at Turing are React and Redux. The skill of pairing effectively is invaluable, too.

## Submittal

* Students will submit a pull request of their markdown document to the [Turing Portfolios Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) no later than 8:30 am on Thursday of Week 6.
* The pull request will add a single file in a directory with their name in their cohort directory and will be named with the date, their name, and their module (e.g. `/students/1801-back/jeff-casimir/20180301-jeff-casimir-m4.md`). Pull requests that change/delete the existing template, or add/remove/edit other files will be closed.
* The markdown file should include a link to your 30-day post graduation action plan.
