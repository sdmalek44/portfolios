# Mod 4 Portfolio

## Biggest Achievement

Learning JavaScript really felt like learning a foreign language and gave me some perspective on why that term was chosen. I've been using CSS and HTML for a long time, and I feel privileged that my previous experience with CSS and HTML freed up some available headspace for JavaScript. My biggest accomplishment of Mod4 and Turing more broadly is that I understand how to use this tool, approach a problem, and where to look for guidance if I get stuck. 

## Biggest struggle

Our open source project was one of my low points at Turing. It taught me a good deal about team dynamics and communication. If my team had implemented a concrete workflow and thorough set up process, I believe we could have avoided most, if not all, of the pitfalls that we encountered. Before our open source project, I had no idea what working in an existing codebase was like, let alone, an open source project. Now I feel like I have a whole new appreciation for the gift that open source projects are. You’re talking about highly skilled people, most of whom, have jobs, who are just giving away their work for free - that's wild. 

## What sets me apart? 

My background spans several different industries, but most of the work I’ve done has been focused on what people can see. I hope that my experience with product design, graphic design, animation, and marketing set me apart from other junior developers. I also believe that my social attitude sets me apart from many of my peers. I want to see the world become a more equitable place, and I believe that technology is an important tool in that process.

## Full stack experience

I really enjoyed seeing the other side of software development and beginning to understand the complexities of data storage and delivery. I’d really like to work on converting my personal project from Mod3 (Hello World) into a full stack application. I plan on doing this post-graduation; leveraging a Node backend with express and knex to improve performance and error management. I believe that learning the back-end makes me a better front-end developer. Knowing the fundamentals of back-end programming gives me more empathy for my peers, and a better vantage point to ask questions in the places where the front-end and back-end interact.

## Skillset

I’m done a lot of school in my life, but I’ve never done something like Turing. I think what’s so important about my experience here is that Turing taught me how to learn, and how to approach a problem when I don’t know what step one is. Even though frameworks and languages come in and out of vogue, I know I can succeed with whatever technology I need to pick up. Post Turing, I’d love to learn more language and frameworks, the basics of computer security, machine learning, and data science.
