### Learning Goals:
 
Gain comfort speaking about and defending my work and code using correct technical vocabulary...
Practice speaking in front of a group...
Build the skill of storytelling by presenting a compelling story about myself and my work...

### Biggest achievement of the module.

 “I guess I should talk about the time that I did that awesome thing but really all I can think about is my capstone. I’m pretty proud of that one... Even though it’s a pointless app I still feel like it was a huge accomplishment for me
personally. A lot of growth, thats for sure.”


 ### What provided me with the most struggle? What did I gain from that struggle?
I think the code challenges we’ve been doing during the morning hours have been the “most struggle” for me. Those things make me feel nice and dumb right as I’m feeling nice and big. Just gotta keep practicing I guess.

### What have I done this inning that sets me apart from my peers?

Always the first person in the classroom each morning, always the last to leave at night
Continued raising a child
Continued working a job that I hate and can’t wait to get out of
Quit drinking with everyone after class to let myself focus more on Turing
Did a wheelie on my bike on the way in this morning Got good at juggling/all the other toys in the classroom

    
 ### “How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack impact what you wanted to do after Turing?”

I still definitely want to be front end focussed even though I had a very good time working with back end technologies

 ### What is the most important skill or lesson I will take from Turing into my next job?

Be okay with it taking time. Don;'t expect immediate results and remember that the people around you probably expect less of you than you expect from yourself


### 30 day action plan

I seemed to have not saved the previous 30 day plan. This is a rough outline of what my days will look like, pretty straightforward. Lots of code wars and job hunting.
