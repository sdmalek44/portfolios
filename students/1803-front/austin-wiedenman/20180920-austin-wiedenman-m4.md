## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I think that my biggest achievement this mod is either that I am finally feeling more comfortable with testing React or getting more exposure to backend development.  
	I think I may have written more tests in this last project than I have in all my previous combined.  I paired a couple times over testing, once with a mentor and another time with a close friend.  Testing is something that has not been clicking for me and It feels really good to finally not dread the idea of having to write frontend tests.  I really enjoyed getting more familiar with relational databases, and using express and knex to build a out a backend.  I was also happy that I got to see some Ruby in action during House of Vars and in our capstone.  I by no means know what is going on in the code, but by seeing Ruby and itâ€™s file structure and understanding portions of it, I feel more confident in my ability to pick it up sometime in the future.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle? 
Mod 4 has been a very busy mod. In addition to covering a wide variety of topics on a surface level, learning how to build out a backend, working on multiple projects and leaving React to go back to Vanilla JS, we are searching for jobs. It can often be hard to make sure you are staying on track in so many areas at once.  I have had to stay organized using tools to better organize my time and I feel like this mod it was even further solidified.  	

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I have been working on developing better lifestyle habits for a few mods. This mod I have been focusing on nutrition and sleep and I have been having more focus and have been able to focus longer.

Regardless of the fact I was not able to implement a PWA into my capstone, I am really interested in learning more about progressive web apps.  I think the idea of the offline capabilities is really cool and I want to explore caching information in more depth.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing?
I think that I still would like to try to find a job working in a modern JS framework like React. However, this mod has definitely opened my eyes to the potential possibilities that exist on the other side.  I can see myself liking to learn more about the backend.
### How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
As a very top-down type of learner, mod 4 has been one of my favorites.   I have really enjoyed being able to go full circle with my learning and understand how databases are created and how those endpoints that we have been using are determined. Even though I have only touch the surface with the the backend, It feels clarifying to know what the full picture looks like.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Turing has taught me discipline, how to open my mind to the idea of growth mindset and that we all have limitless learning potential. It has taught me how to research problems and implement solutions.  It has taught me how to collaborate in technical settings, and taught me to persevere regardless of setbacks.  I think that Turing has made me tough.  I know that I can take on difficult challenges and overcome them.
