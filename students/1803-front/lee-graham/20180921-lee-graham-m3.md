Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)
I was very eager to start building out full react applications, as much as I have loved working with others. 

#### (HeadCount 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/headcount2.2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

(description)
HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.  

The application displays educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district and allows the user to search by district as well as compare stats between two different districts.

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, with Javascript, React, and CSS styling. It was tested with Jest and enzyme.

#### (NOSA)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

(description)
The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.

I was challenged with using the NASA api, using photo editing, for users who are flat earth believers.
Naturally, I made a website that debunks nasa's satellite images, that allows the flattening of said images, and then the adding of those images to template stickers, gift cards, post cards, and posters.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)
These experiences were both fun and challenging.  Working with people as we all discover how to create and maintain
open and honest lines of communication proved to be very difficult this mod. 

#### (SWapi Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/Swapi-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

(description)
The point of this project was to take static data files and, using React, display the data to the page. Using Jest and Enzyme, we built a test suite for the application.

##Built with
* React
* SCSS
* HTML

[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate.
