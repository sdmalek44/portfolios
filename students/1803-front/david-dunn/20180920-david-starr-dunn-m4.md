# Module 4 Portfolio Presentation

## Learning Goals

* Gain comfort speaking about and defending their work and code using correct technical vocabulary
* Practice speaking in front of a group
* Build the skill of storytelling by presenting a compelling story about themselves and their work

## Requirements

* Students will prepare a markdown document and submit a pull request to the Turing Portfolios Repository using the template provided (more detail below under ***Submittal***).
* Students will also prepare a 10-12 minute slide presentation to give to a panel of 3-4 reviewers.

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Finishing the capstone.
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Getting the photo uploads to work was the biggest snag. I was reminded to persevere and timebox issues, and ask for help sometimes.
* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
It was great to gain a better understanding of the back end and see how FE and BE work together. In the future, I'd like to call myself a fullstack engineer.
* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Don't panic too long, look it up, ask your peers.

Module 4 at Turing was full of challenges and achievements, and flew by. It's hard to believe that I'm about to graduate. In looking back at the last 6 weeks, I appreciate the variety of projects I've worked on, as well as the overall number of projects. By the beginning of Mod 4, I was definitely ready do dive into the server side and learn about what goes on in the back end. Learning the new tech was an interesting challenge as well. Altogether it made the back end much less intimidating. I also appreciate the vanilla JS projects, as opportunities to refresh my JQuery and CSS. While the student led gear-up was a pain to prepare in the midst of all the other coursework, I'm glad I put in the effort to do it right. Having completed the program, I feel confident that I can succeed through diligence and hard work.

#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students will submit a pull request of their markdown document to the [Turing Portfolios Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) no later than 8:30 am on Thursday of Week 6.
* The pull request will add a single file in a directory with their name in their cohort directory and will be named with the date, their name, and their module (e.g. `/students/1801-back/jeff-casimir/20180301-jeff-casimir-m4.md`). Pull requests that change/delete the existing template, or add/remove/edit other files will be closed.
* The markdown file should include a link to your 30-day post graduation action plan.
