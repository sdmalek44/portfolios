<b>Mod 4 Portfolio Presentation:</b>

This module I learned new technologies as well as reviewed fundamental concepts. Learning how to make a backend and creating a full stack application was an exciting and rewarding experience. Therefore I believe one of my biggest accomplishments was doing just that. The final involved making a simple fullstack application and making that application live. I have to create a server, create a schema for a database, link the database to the server, then test the two. I then had to quickly whip up a front end to interact with that server all in 5 hours. Completing this challenge shows that I have achieved the main technical goals of this module.
  
My other big achievement would be getting involved in the tech community. I've gone to several meetups and have started consistently going to code for boulder. I have volunteered to work on an API they are contructing for non profits. Just from spending my limited time there I have already heard of many new frameworks and been exposed to new languages and technologies.
  
The biggest struggle of this module was balancing the work while getting involved in the community and looking for jobs. Each side took prioritization at different points. Another load of work was reviewing the fundamentals and expanding my technical knowledge and problem solving ability. I've been doing code war challenges and upon refactoring my submission I instantly see 3 other refactors that are much more efficient.

Besides getting involved with code-for-boulder. I have set myself apart from my peers by working with react-native. Although the general flow is the same as react, there are many big and little differences that take some time to get accostumed to. With this experience I will not get stuck on various react-native idiosyncracies and be able to use it more efficiently.

The technologies learned this module has made me want to practice making servers in other languages. Javascript is incredibly versatile but it is still only one of many languages. After seeing how quickly one of my project partners created a ruby on rails server, I would really like to learn that technology. I am going to have that goal as a side project while looking for jobs. I also plan to find another coding group to be involved in because that will also expose me to new technologies as I work on code bases with other people. I also learned that I can always expand on the fundamentals and I can't use react for everything.

Overall this course has taught me the basics of coding and to not be intimidated by new technologies. Repeatedly I've been baffled by the introduction to a technology, yet not even a week later I am using it to build an application with a solid basic understanding of what I'm writing. The first attempt means nothing. At the end of the day, there's nothing black magic about a framework and understanding the parts just takes time.
