# Lucas Alderfer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing with the sole goal of learning how to be a developer with all it includes.  Though all inclusive learning in any field is impossible in the span of 6 weeks, I believe that Turing does set out the expectation for the incoming student that they will be taught the range of topics needed for one to be a developer.  Knowing relatively little of what that may encapsulate, I suppose I would somewhat tongue-in-cheek say that my goal was to complete mod 1.  More specifically and pointedly my goals after beginning mod 1 became to learn how to solve problems using Ruby and understand the Object Oriented Programming model.  Despite the breadth of these goals, I think that at the end of the mod I have reached a passing understanding of OOP and have developed the ability to adequately solve problems for which Ruby is well suited.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 2 (It took me a few weeks to keep my head above water personally, after which time I have tried to be helpful and collaborative with my classmates to be a positive part of the community)

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Throughout the module I believe I consistently failed different aspects of each project, and doing this helped me to really commit to memory different ways of programming.  All this is to say, I feel each project was a substantial aspect of my overall body of work due to the progress made through failure.

# Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

**Description**
This project assignment was to make a version of the game Mastermind that ran on a REPL interface.  The game Mastermind creates a random sequence of characters which each correspond to a color.  Traditionally this would be 4 characters which are each one of 4 colors, however we were challenged to also have versions that the user could opt to have more characters and more color options for increased difficulty.  The user then attempts to guess combinations of characters attempting to guess the generated sequence and is given feedback on their guesses letting them know how many of their guesses were the right color, and how many of those right colors were also in the correct position.

**Evaluation**
This project was not officially graded or scored, I did get a lot of feedback on my runner file, how to write code that would better lend itself to testability, and ultimately discussed moving out of the echo group based on time spent to complete this project.

# Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/Sorting-Cards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

**Description**
This project assignment was to make a set of objects that range from cards to decks and rounds.  These objects have a number of expected relations to one another, and then finally the rounds need to be able to merge sort the cards, to require us to code a merge sort.  

**Evaluation  Comments**
* Got sort and merge sort working
* Merge sort method breaks I1
* Sorting methods are REALLY long
* A lot of information is being stored in Round as opposed to calculated


**Evaluation Scores**
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 2
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Functionality: 2

# Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

**Description**
This was a paired project that required us to create a series of classes that could take input from a text file, encrypt that text using the date and a randomly generated number key, write that text to a file, decrypt an encrypted text file given the key and date, and also to decrypt encrypted text given only the date and determine what the random key for the encryption was.

**Evaluation  Comments**
* Files that projects works with are hard coded.
* Some repetition in code
* Some opportunities to refactor
* instances where #each is used
* Organized well

**Evaluation Scores**
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Git Workflow: 3
4. Functionality: 2

# Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/Battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

**Description**
This project was to create a version of the classic game Battleship which had two ships per player on a 4 by 4 board, allowing the placement of the ship, guessing, and feedback to run though a REPL interface.  This project required us to use OOP on a much higher level than previously and forced a much more sophisticated use of runner files than had been required in mastermind, as well as raising the bar for TDD on methods that may be more difficult to test based on user input or randomness.

**Evaluation  Comments & Scores**
I do not have any official feedback from this project, however I received plenty of feedback from Brian on it and had plenty of thoughts on it myself.  Although I did complete this project and it was fully functional, my project was not completed in the spirit of the learning goals for the project such that my verification of ship placements and board positions was based on a series of hash libraries rather than positions or information held in classes.  I did however learn the value of doing things in an object oriented way, and truly feel that the evaluation session for Battleship and talking through the way I should have done it was the turning point for me in this mod.  My TDD and runner file did improve vastly in this assignment as compared to previous assignments.

# Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

**Description**
Black Thursday challenged us to create a series of databases that each could hold pieces of information that related to information in other databases, and then asked us to evaluate the total information held in all the databases on certain criteria in another class.  This project was aimed at allowing us to create something useful while still using only information that we had learned so far, though for each topic we were pushed to the extent of our knowledge.

**Evaluation  Comments & Scores**
Angela and I sufficiently completed this project, although I need to continue to work on value based programming and testing, and continue to improve my Git workflow.


## D: Professional Skills

Throughout this mod, we have worked on establishing for ourselves who we are as workers, our strengths and weaknesses and how we should be aware of the state of the programming environment professionally, both in order to fit into it and to resist its negative aspects.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

This professional development session was geared towards learning never to say that you cannot do something.  For every challenge we are faced with, we must embrace the concept that we can do it, we just need to learn.  This helps us to avoid a pessimistic mindset and helps preserve our mental health by encouraging us to be positive.

#### Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This professional development session was geared towards understanding that whether we are introverted or extroverted is not a binary relationship, but a scale.  By establishing that people are never 100% one or the other we begin to undermine built up schemas around people we may have.  We also discussed the way in which people at different points on the spectrum work in order to become better teammates.

#### Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

This professional development session was geared towards discussing the way in which people get stressed and how they deal with their stress.  We discussed the ways in which everyone is different in how they work and how they deal with stress.  Having felt very stressed at the time due to time constraints, it felt ironic that many of the suggestions were to step away from our work as I did not feel empowered to do that what so ever.

#### Personal Stories & Connection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

This professional development was geared towards teaching us how to tell the story of who we are as professionals in an interview setting.  It was helpful to practice this and understand the types of things we will want to leverage as people who are moving from one career to another.  I generally feel more capable of understanding what to leverage in a conversation with more context than just a general 'What would you tell someone?'.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

This professional development discussed the issue of gender in the realm of the programming profession.  It was helpful to know both the history of this issue in this specific field and also that it is a recognized and well established issue in terms of its being actively addressed.  It was both enheartening and disheartening to listen to this PD as gender gap issues are a sad reality of any profession, but the extent to which attention is being drawn to the reality of the issue in this field seems to be far better and more pervasive than in many others which is a far better place to be at.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My main participation in the Turing community was that I tried to be around to help classmates for each project and collaborate with others on how to solve tough issues.
