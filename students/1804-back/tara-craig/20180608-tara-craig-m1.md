# Tara Craig - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This first mod, I set out to learn and explore Ruby, as well as wrap my head around the basics of learning programming. Mod 1 confirmed what I already knew: that I had no idea what I was doing. Since the initial first weeks of panic, I have gained more knowledge and become more comfortable working with my computer instead of against it. I am looking forward to repeating mod 1 with a better foundation and understanding of programming and Ruby.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Repeat mod 1

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

The Luhn Algorithm project had us verify that a credit card number was valid based on the Luhn Algorithm. It introduced us to working with classes, methods, real world experience with Github, and TDD.

This project was not evaluated or scored.

#### Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/sorting_cards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

The Sorting Cards project is a project that is used through the command line, and allows a user to see cards, guess a card, and sort the cards. This project gave us experience with using multiple classes, running programs through the command line, and more extensive testing than we had previously done.

###### Evaluation Comments
* Completed most of I2, got to but not including current card

###### Evaluation Scores
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Functionality: 1

#### Wizarding Bank

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/wizarding_bank)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/wizarding_bank)

Wizarding Bank was about Gringott's Wizarding Bank, and had us create bank and person classes. This gave us more practice working with different classes and TDD.

This project was evaluated but comments and scores were not recorded.

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/Chisel)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/chisel)

Chisel was a project that had us create a markdown parser that converted markdown syntax to HTML. It gave us more experience with using multiple classes, TDD, markdown, and Github, as well as introducing us to HTML.

This project was not evaluated or scored.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sdmalek44/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Enigma had us build an encryption engine for encrypting a message using a key and offset, decrypting that message, and cracking a message with just the date. We gained experience with using multiple classes, breaking problems down into smaller components, and TDD. It also introduced us to running files from the command line and outputting messages into the file system.

###### Evaluation Comments
* All three things work
* A lot of stuff jammed into Enigma class
* Runner files could be refactored

###### Evaluation Scores
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 3
4. Git Workflow: 3
4. Functionality: 3

###### Partner Feedback
I really appreciated your willingness to work long hours on this project. You came in on Saturday and Sunday to work on it all day. When you were there, you were focused and patient. We were there all day Saturday and Sunday and not once did you complain or ask to leave. You wanted to get the work done as much as I did. It didn't matter if you were typing or directing, you always were patient with me when I lost my train of thought or got frustrated. You communicated very well when we had to work separately on Wednesday. On slack you updated me with everything you were doing which was nice. When you were ready to commit and merge  you told me so. Overall it was a great experience working with you. You said at the beginning that you didn't feel super comfortable with all of the material. I suppose I would suggest setting aside a small amount of time each day to do some of the exercises. The mythical creatures is a good one that really helped me with TDD.  And although I am guilty of this as well,  on Saturday and Sunday I noticed that you didn't get up from your chair very much and take a break. It is good for your brain to get up and walk around a bit every once and a while when you're working. It is hard to take breaks when you know there is a lot of work to be done but it is important I think.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Week 1: Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I found the information presented about stress to be incredibly interesting and helpful. I can become stressed very easily, especially if I am not taking care of myself (such as eating healthy, exercise, take time for myself, etc.), and it negatively affects my work. I found during this mod that I let some of those things go (exercise!) in favor of working on projects, and I think that in the long run it actually hindered my progress. Next mod I am going to focus a little bit more on planning my time more efficiently and making sure I take care of myself.

#### Week 3: Code Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This was a really interesting and insightful Gear Up. The snippets that we saw from the movie were engaging and I plan on watching the full documentary over our break. I also found the discussions after the clips to be really fun and enlightening, as well as somewhat reassuring. Many of my classmates are male and so I was not sure going into the discussions how they would react, but I found that everyone was receptive to the message of the movie and also made many interesting points themselves.

#### Week 5: Choice Session, Mod 4 facilitated - Using Public Data

The Using Public Data session facilitated by Mod 4 students looked into using API and publicly available data to give back to the community, or fulfill a need that may be overlooked by other organizations. Some of the students from the upper mods told us about their own personal projects and how they have been using public data. I had no idea how much public data has been made available (like NASA has released data, crazy), but its pretty exciting to know that it is out there. I have already started thinking of potential personal projects that I could do that involve public data.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was not as involved this mod as I would have liked. I did go to a few Pohlke Posse meetings, but when I became overwhelmed with the projects I stopped going. Next mod I would like to start up again and go to all of the meetings.

I would also like to give back on an individual level. Now that I have a better grasp of the material, I look forward to helping some of the newer students with questions they may have.
