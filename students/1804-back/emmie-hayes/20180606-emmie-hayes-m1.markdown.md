# Emmie Hayes - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At some point over the past six weeks I had brush in with confidence and it was just the thing I needed.  I supposed we can conclude that repeating module one paid off tenfold.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/credit_check)

Objective- Build a program following Luhn's algorithm for validating credit card numbers.  
Personal Goal- Avoid chaining methods and implement a runner file.


#### Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/merge_sort)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

Objective- Build a program featuring fundamental sorting algorithms.
Personal Goal- Follow SRP for methods, learn to sort algorithmically.

Instructor Feedback:
Good edge case testing if a value comes into a card as an integer
test_response_is_a_string is redundant
Tests for guess class should not cover card functionality
Testing concat_card_attributes is a good example of unit testing
Great use of helper methods in record_guess
Always be as specific as possible with assertions. Use assert_equal instead of assert_instance_of wherever you can

Grade:
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3
3. Test-Driven Development: 2
4. Functionality: 3

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Objective- Build an implementation of the 90s board game Battleship.
Personal Goal- Find balance with unit and integration testing, map clean boolean logic.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Paired Projects

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Objective- Build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages.
Personal Goal- Identify and utilize a partners strengths, complete the project, refactor.

Instructor Feedback:
Files that projects works with are hard coded.
Some repetition in code
Some opportunities to refactor
instances where #each is used
Organized well


Partner Feedback:
Emmie is great at refactoring, and knew a lot about GitHub, HoundCI, SimpleCov. She was willing to consistently give me input when she knew of a better or faster way to do the same things I was thinking but taking a roundabout method.  Emmie was also very understanding of my time constraints and never did anything without explaining what she was doing first despite having more experience in coding than myself. We share a tendency to think through the full ramifications of our actions before we do anything, and I think we both had instances of analysis paralysis because of that (I am specifically thinking about our final problem with making up for rolling over our character map in encryption).  Whether its because of an approaching deadline or the scale of the problem, always slowing down and only thinking about the next step (within a planned process) would have helped us both greatly at different points.  I word this in the plural because I felt we had similar mindsets through this project and have found myself thinking that the times where I was lost for where to start this is what I should have done.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emmiehayes/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

Objective- Build a system to manage Etsy data and execute business intelligence queries against the data
Personal Goal- Identify and utilize a partners strength, manage time wisely in order to meet the needs of the client, and optimize large data set querying with memoization.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Health & Wellness- Week 1
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)
I appreciate the support Turing provides with regards to stress and how it can manifest.  This session alongside the Head Space app set me up for success.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap- Week 2
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)
This session is what inspires me to continue pushing forward when I start doubting myself.  To be on the forefront of something is an opportunity that I will not let pass me by.

#### AI caraumba- Week 5
A lot of take aways from this session...most notably this video:
