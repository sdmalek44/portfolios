# Angela Duran - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the basics of ruby programming and do some cool projects. I feel like I was successful for the most part, and learned some other stuff along the way. I learned a lot about TDD and version control and those have been extremely useful. I also learned some stuff not necessarily related to coding; for example, we touched upon some really useful professional development topics.


## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 2

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed the end of module assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Throughout the individual projects I feel like I demonstrated my growing knowledge of ruby implementation. They were challenging but I learned a lot from all of them, most especially TDD. (Not that I'm anywhere near done learning that!)

### **Mastermind**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/duranangela/Mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

**Description:** This project was a REPL that prompted a user to guess what the computer's random chosen colors were. The user kept guessing until they got it right, or they could (c)heat and see the answer.

**Evaluation:**
* Ruby Syntax & Style - 3.5
* Breaking Logic into Components 2.5
* Test-Driven Development - 1
* Functionality - 4

### **Sorting Cards**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/duranangela/SortingCards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

**Description:** This project was an exercise in building classes that worked together.

**Evaluation:**
* Ruby Syntax & Style - 4
* Breaking Logic into Components 3.5
* Test-Driven Development - 2.75
* Functionality - 3

### **Battleship**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/duranangela/Battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

**Description:** This project was an implementation of the game Battleship, using the command line. It had several classes that worked together to created a functional game.

**Evaluation:**
* Ruby Syntax & Style - 3.5
* Breaking Logic into Components 3.5
* Test-Driven Development - 2.75
* Functionality - 3
* Version Control - 3.5


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on two group projects, **Enigma** and **Black Thursday**. I really appreciated working with someone as coding with a partner was definitely a new experience. The whole process helped solidify my understanding of Git and GitHub, which I was pretty shaky on at the beginning.

### **Enigma**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/duranangela/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

**Description:** This project was designed to encrypt messages, decrypt coded messages, and crack coded messages.

**Evaluation comments:**
Overall, well structured
Some opportunities to refactor
Some repetitive code

**Evaluation:**
* Ruby Syntax & Style - 3
* Breaking Logic into Components 3
* Test-Driven Development - 3
* Git Workflow - 3

### **Black Thursday**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LucasAlderfer/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

**Description:** This project was a data analysis project using lots of data and lots of classes to manipulate that data.

**Evaluation:** I'm not sure what the actual scores were but our verbal feedback was good overall.

## D: Professional Skills

I thought the Professional Development sessions were really valuable and I learned a lot from them. I'm not sure if we're supposed to list all of the sessions here because below this is only asking for Gear Up sessions, but I'd like to say I really liked the session about Growth Mindset - it was a great start to this mod. I also liked the session about Introverts and Extroverts - it helped me see the whole things as a spectrum rather than an either/or situation.

### Gear Up

### **Mental Health 101**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

What I learned from this session was that I need to keep a close eye on my stress levels and do what I can to alleviate stress. Stress levels being too high can cause real problems with physical, mental and emotional health. I have been thinking a lot about where my tolerance levels are and what I can do in terms of self-care .


### **Code Debugging the Gender Gap**

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This session reinforced my understanding of what it means to be a woman in a world that isn't always inclusive for women.
I did learn some history of women in the tech industry that I didn't know before, and that was cool. I am hoping to be able to take some time to watch the entire movie on Netflix over the break.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I've definitely feel I've fallen short on Community Participation. I'd like to be more involved with the Joan Clarke Society, and I'm planning on working more on that goal in the upcoming mod. Outside of that I did help some classmates at various points, and I do feel good about the work I did with my mentor.
