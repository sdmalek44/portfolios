some long names contributed to this!
Great job pulling out key and offset classes, would like to see encrytor/decryptor pulled out into classes.

## D: Professional Skills
My experience at Turing has helped me develop my professional identity. Unlike many of the students here, I do not have a background in tech. Because of this, the professional development emphasis is particularly important for me. I was able to create a LinkedIn account and groom my other social media accounts based on the information provided in the professional development sessions. 


### Gear Up
#### Week 1: Health & Wellness
My accountabilibuddy and I spoke regularly and shared what we each did for self-care. I appreciated having someone to check-in with and felt encouraged when we chatted. I also really enjoyed the mid-mod SAB outdoor activities. 

#### Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap
This gear up topic was very interesting and informative. I took advantage of the open discussion to hear from male students how they feel about this issue. It was helpful to get real world opinions from peers. 

#### Week 5: Mod 4-led Choice: Technology and Mental Health
I appreciated the informal nature of the Mod 4 led gear ups. The chosen topic was very relevant and informative. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I supported the Turing community by cheering for both the instructors and the students at the basketball game. I also brought a bunch of Twinkies and snack cakes.
