# Erik Schneider - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I had zero experience with programming coming into Turing.  I'm hoping to change careers and coding is something that is calming to me.  (Let's be honest - I'm hopeful that I get to that point because right now in the learning process it is extremely stressful.)  Did I succeed in that regard?  Because I am repeating module 1, the answer is no.  However, I have learned more than I admit to myself.  My biggest issue at this point are the fundamentals - which I don't have an excellent grasp of yet.  I also made the cardinal sin the first time around - I did not concentrate on what I needed.  Rather than work exercises and lessons plans over and over (to strengthen those skills), I concentrated on projects.  But because I didn't have the base level of knowledge, I would spin my wheels.  That is going to change as I know I won't succeed by not strengthening what I need to for myself.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Because I will be repeating module 1, I did not take the end of module assessment.  It was identified earlier in the module that I would be repeating.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Health & Wellness - I learned about coping with stress.  What triggers it for me and how I can better manage it.  One of the issues that I have is trying to power through an issue - rather than taking breaks.  I've woken up in the middle of the night with a thought around a problem I'm trying to solve.  If I had walked away from it earlier and come back to it - maybe that same thought would have occurred.  Life can't center around what makes you stressed.  Exercise is key, breaks are key and communication with others are key.

Debugging the Gender Gap - In all honesty, I didn't know this existed to the extent that it is out there.  I tend to get wrapped up in my own world and easily miss what is going on around me.  In today's world, diversity is key.  Diversity makes a stronger team as different opinions can solve a solution faster and better.  

You Probably Won't Come - I did not enjoy this session at all.  I signed up for hoping to receive useful pointers around dealing with the imposter syndrome and other stressful issues.  Instead, it seemed to be an extremely negative story sharing session without many useful tips.  I want to have a positive attitude when I am feeling lost.  My take away - and putting a positive spin on it - is that I don't want to be the negative one.  I don't want others to say - he just complains.  I want to have a positive influence on others and that starts with how I approach it. 




## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I stayed inside the compounds of Module 1 this session.  I would like to get out more in the future.  I did reach out to a former Turing student (in addition to my mentor) and hold several conversations with her on advice and learning.  The future is what you put into it today.
