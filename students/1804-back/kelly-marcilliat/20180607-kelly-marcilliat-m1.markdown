# (Kelly Marcilliat) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
There are several objectives I wanted to attain this module.  I wanted to:
 - be able to use, at least at a fundamental level, the basic structures and concepts of the Ruby language,
 - exhibit the habits and attitude of an assertive learner,
 - get to know my classmates and be a source of support for them,
 - become proficient with the Atom/command line environment,
 - perform at a promotion-supporting level on all assignments, projects, and assessments, and
 - be ready for Mod2.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: NA
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 2.5
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
NA - exempted from final assessment due to repeater status


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Credit Check)

* [GitHub URL](NA)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
Create code performing the validation of a credit card number.

(evaluation comments)
None recorded.  From memory, the feedback showed some understanding, however, my code was monolithic rather than broken into methods.

(evaluation scores)
No score given

#### (Sorting Cards)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KellyMarcilliat/card_sort_project)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

(evaluation comments)
A few places where you are testing the methods of a class - in a different classes test file.
Tests should cover more edge cases - example: card should not only test "Ace" and "Spades" as we could get a false positive if "Ace" and "Spades" were hard-coded.

(evaluation scores)
Ruby Syntax and Style - 3
Breaking Logic into Components - 3
TDD - 2
Functionality - 1.5


#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KellyMarcilliat/Battleship)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

(evaluation comments)
None recorded.  Discussed repeating Mod1

(evaluation scores)
No score given

#### (Wizarding Bank)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KellyMarcilliat/Wizarding_Bank)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Enigma)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KellyMarcilliat/enigma)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

(evaluation comments)
Discussed the issues my partner and I had in making our work come together.  Simply, we approached the project with an assumption that divide and conquer would be our best strategy.  This proved to be a mistaken assumption, and we struggled to recognize our deficiencies until there was no time left to remediate.

(evaluation scores)
Not scored.

(feedback to me)
"Thanks for your hard work on the project.  You did an excellent job getting the pieces together and building each of the parts. Take some more time to look over any methods you are building.  Be mindful of which methods require arguments and where they will need to be syntactically"


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
Stress is a regular factor in endeavors such as this.  During our time at Turing, both we and our peers will find ourselves exhibiting stress behaviors.  Recognizing those bahaviors in ourselves gives us the opportunity to manage them.  Recognizing them in our peers gives us the opportunity to support and empathize.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
Having spent much of the last two decades in the tech industry, I have seen the gender gap daily.  Nonetheless, I was stunned at the degree to which it has actually worsened over the last few decades.  To see that it peaked in the '80s was disheartening.  Turing's mission regarding diversity is one of the reasons I picked Turing.  My role in the issue is one of opportunity - the opportunity to be something other than what people first think when they see me - "here's another middle-aged white dude."  It is a personal value of mine to be a part of the change.

#### (You Probably Won't Pick This One)

* [GitHub URL](NA)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)
This was an interesting insight into how difficult self-doubt is even for people of obvious ability.  I think frequently of the comments from one of my group members regarding the near-paralyzing fear brought on by the interview process.  Clearly, this person is smart, and as a Mod4 student, they've had to perform greatly under high adversity.  It makes me question deeply the efficacy of the interview process and how I may change it when I am interviewing candidates to work for me.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Throughout this mod, I have tried to offer support and optimism to those around me.  I make an effort to listen - as each of us needs to vent now and then.  I've congratulated my classmates on their successes, whished them luck on their current challenges, and helped prop them up after disappointments.
Outside of the classroom, I have sat on the Q&A panel for a Try Turing Weekend, and I have volunteered to assist as a TA.  This weekend, I will be setting up the Turing booth at the Denver Pride event.
