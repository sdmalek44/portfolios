# Colin Armstrong - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The main focus for me this module was getting a fresh start and taking the first step in starting a successful programming career.  I worked on developing a strong work ethic and good programming habits.  I worked on gaining confidence in basic programming skills.  I learned to use Ruby effectively and also learned how to collaborate with my peers.  I feel the work I've put in during this first module has helped set me up for success in both future modules and my future career.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this module were Mastermind, Date Night, and Battleship.

#### Mastermind

* [Mastermind Repository](https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/mastermind)
* [Mastermind Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

##### Description:
A terminal based REPL implementation of the game Mastermind.

##### Evaluation comments from Brian:

* Make sure naming follows convention
* Could refactor into less classes
* If an Ivar is an easy calculation based off another IVar, it doesn't need to be an Ivar
* Code generator should also test for the right colors

##### Evaluation scores:
* Ruby Syntax and Style: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3

#### Date Night

* [Date Night Repository](https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/date_night)
* [Date Night Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

##### Description:
Implements a binary search tree to parse movie scores related to different movie titles.

##### Evaluation comments from Brian
* Make sure you follow the spec. Each node should hold a title and a score
* Node class is not fully tested. There need to be tests for assigning attribute values, not just reading
* You should test the structure of the tree, not just return values and inclusion
* Remember to be as specifiic as possible in testing. Don't just assert values are greater than other values, assert their exact value
* Shouldn't have variables that are just the data type, i.e. 'array'

##### Evaluation scores:
* Ruby Syntax and Style: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Version Control: 2
* Functionality: 3

#### Battleship

* [Battleship Repository](https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/battleship)
* [Battleship Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

##### Description:
Implements a scaled down version of the board game Battleship in the terminal.

##### Evaluation comments from Amy
* Extremely clean and clear and consistent - I ENJOY reading your code and I don't say that often
* Thoughtful design decisions üôå


##### Evaluation scores
* Ruby Syntax and Style:  3.5 üëç
* Breaking Logic into Components:  4
* Test-Driven Development:  3
* Functionality: 3
* Version Control: 3


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The paired projects I completed this module were Enigma and Black Thursday

#### Enigma

* [Enigma Repository](https://github.com/clairebvs/Enigma)
* [Engima Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

##### Description
Implements an "enigma machine" to encrypt, decrypt, and crack secret messages.

##### Evaluation comments
* Opportunity to refactor things out of the Enigma Class
* Need some edge case testing, for example can you encrypt an empty string?

##### Evaluation scores
* Ruby Syntax and Style:  3
* Breaking Logic into Components:  3
* Test-Driven Development:  3
* Git Workflow: 3
* Functionality: 3

##### Feedback to me
First of all, I have really appreciate pairing with Colin and I am grateful for that. Colin is someone really receptive to what you can say to him (concern, help, advice) which make the pairing pleasant as it makes the communication easier.
I have appreciate also that Colin took the time to explain a method or something that I had trouble to understand. He is a good teacher using often paper to draw and do what he is verbalizing. I will say to double check when working with people that you are not creating a gap between what they understand and are and where you are and understand as Colin as a brilliant and fast mind. But thanks to the fact that Colin is receptive and aware of his environment I do not think that it will lead to some kind of trouble.

#### Black Thursday

* [Black Thursday Repository](https://github.com/colinwarmstrong/black_thursday)
* [Black Thursday Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

##### Description
Implements a system to manage data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

##### Evaluation comments from Amy
Feedback overall was pretty good.  Some methods could be refactored down and my sales analyst has some methods that are repetitive.  Test-driven development can also be improved.

##### Evaluation Scores
Based on feedback, I would guess I received mostly threes and a four for functionality.


## D: Professional Skills
The gear up sessions for this mod have helped me develop good work habits, manage stress, and start thinking about myself as a programmer.

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

* [Mental Health 101 Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Mental health 101 helped me better manage my stress during my time at Turing.  I've been trying to be more mindful and focus on my breathing when I start getting stressed.  It also helped me realize how important sleep and exercise is to managing stress and keeping me focused.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Debugging the gender gap was a very eye opening lesson.  It helped me realize that I need to be mindful of the needs and struggles of others.  It's sometimes hard for me to see those struggles and this session helped me be more aware of them.

#### Imposter Syndrome

This was a gear up session led by mod four students.  I didn't end up getting much out of this session, it didn't seem very well prepared.  I was hoping to learn how to stay confident when I am struggling to learn something as I get discouraged easily.  I was also hoping this session would help me get into more of a growth mindset.  Overall this gear up session was not very useful.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I feel like I was able to get to know everyone in my cohort fairly well over the last six weeks and develop a few close friendships.  I was pretty shy the first couple of weeks but have really felt connected to my cohort-mates these last few weeks.  I am happy with the relationships I have built with my classmates.  I was happy with the help and guidance I was able to give to others as I grew more confident in Ruby and programming in general.  It was really gratifying when people started reaching out to me for help and advice on Black Thursday.  I feel I had a positive impact on the success of a lot of people in this mod which.
