# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

To accomplish this module, I have been invested from day one until the last day making sure I could progress everyday.
I have work hard but I above all apply everything that I have been told to to make sure that every minutes that I was working was a productive minutes.
I have paired more often with my mentor, twice a week at least for a total of 4 hours or more, and I have also been asking Becki questions on slack very often.  It has been extremely beneficial to me. I think I was probably more receptive to the information than the first time around. I also paired more often with students here at Turing especially with Jude (every week).
Also, to make sure my time spend was productive I have been using the pomodoro timer and when facing difficulties it helped me to make sure I was going to take time away before to try to work on the same problem. And if I still cannot solve the problem I will go to see someone else and explain them what I am trying to do, how I am trying to solve it to receive a feedback if I am trying to do something not possible or if I am missing a piece of the puzzle but not having "the" answer or their way to do.
I have shown also a better time management between projects and exercises this time. Doing more exercises and reviewing the foundation during the week break has been very helpful.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed according my progression this module.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here is a recap of the projects I have been doing during module 1 :
CreditCheck week 1,
SortingCards week 2,
Enigma week 3,
Battleship week 4,
Black Thursday week 5 and 6.


#### (Project Name)

I / Project Name = CreditCheck
* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/credit_check.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check

Using Luhn ALgorithm, we had to check if a credit card number is valid or not.

Evaluation comments : Make sure to remove all comments and pry and adding more edge case testing.
Evaluation scores :
1. Ruby Syntax and Styles = 3.5: Meets expectations
2. Breaking Logic into Components = 4: Meets expectations
3. Test-Driven Development = 3: Meets expectations
4. Functionality = 3: Meets expectations

II / Project name = SortingCards
* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/SortingCards.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards

A user will be able to see cards, guess what the card is, and sort the cards by creating different objects.

Evaluation comments :
Overally good clean project
Some opportunities to tighten up testing, ask yourself what you are trying to test.
Record guess does not return the appropriate object, and the test does not cover this

Evaluation scores :
1. Ruby Syntax and Styles = 3: Meets expectations
2. Breaking Logic into Components = 3: Meets expectations
3. Test-Driven Development = 3: Meets expectations
4. Functionality = 2: Below expectations

III / Project name = BattleShip
* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/Battleship.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship

Building a Battleship game.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My first paired project was Enigma with Colin Armstrong and my second paired project was Black Thursday with JP.Lynch.

#### (Project Name)

I / Project name = Enigma
* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/clairebvs/Enigma.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma

We had to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

Evaluation comments :
Opportunity to refactor things out of the Enigma Class
Need some edge case testing, for example can you encrypt an empty string?

Evaluation scores :
1. Ruby Syntax and Styles = 3: Meets expectations
2. Breaking Logic into Components = 3: Meets expectations
3. Test-Driven Development = 3: Meets expectations
4. Git Workflow = 3: Meets expectations
5. Functionality = 3: Meets expectations

II / Project name = Black Thursday
* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/JPLynch35/black_thursday.git
* [Original Assignment] = http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday

We had to build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

## D: Professional Skills

Here are the Gear up I have been attending for module 1 : Week 1: Health & Wellness, Week 3: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap, Week 5: Artificial Intelligence

### Gear Up
#### Week 1 Health & Wellness

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

It was really interesting to talk about this topic and figure out about the different type of stress. How stress affects our life quality and our work and what we can do to lower the stress. I definitively pay more attention to breathing and to keep breathing "normally" and deeply even during a moment of stress. I also know that exercises like running help me a lot to reduce stress and that I should do that more often while at Turing because yes we are under a lot of stress. 

#### Week 3 Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL] = https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md

As a woman, I can relate on things that we have seen and talk during this gear up. I also watched again on Netflix the documentary about debugging the gender gap in tech. I am not surprised that few women are part of the Tech industry but I do believe school like Turing or bootcamp in general might help because there is no stigma about women. 

#### Week 5 Artificial Intelligence

* [GitHub URL] = None  

It was a very well led gear up talk and interesting.
I was actually a little bit surprise that not so many people were questioning a safety issue regarding AI. I have learn interesting things such as google assistant and the idea from Amazon to come up with an AI that will know for you or before you what you want to buy.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I leave usually Turing school lately and I am there on the week end so I try to clean the dishes and make the room looks ok (chair, ..).
I think I have tried to be very supportive with the repeaters to make sure that we were staying in a good mood and doing what we have to do to go to module 2.
Other than that I have not been as active in the community as much as I would like and hope to do better next mode.
