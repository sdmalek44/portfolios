## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects



#### Enigma

* [Ghttps://github.com/SSchwartz214/enigma]()
* [Original Assignment]()

Create a program that can encode, decode, and crack code similar to the four rotor coding process used by Germans in WWII.  

Always use assert_equal over assert_instance_of if you can
When testing shifted_character_map method, test that some of the key value pairs are correct
@ciphered_character_map doesn't need be an IVar because it can be easily calculated
As your code base grows, you may want to consider refactoring out of Enigma

I thoroughly enjoyed working with you Andrew.  You always maintained a positive attitude, you sought out help when we got stuck on something and you were open to learning.  It was an excellent idea to write down the git commands/GitHub workflow and reference them when you needed to.  You came up with many working methods that we utilized.  Your determination to learn how methods/arguments interact was evident and going through the interaction pattern of our encrypt method was immensely helpful for both of us.   You were flexible with your time and I appreciate this since I know you have a family at home. Overall you were an excellent partner and will be a great programmer.  I would recommend you practice testing as you weren't quite as automatic as a practiced software developer should be.  Keep up reviewing the GitHub workflow so that becomes automatic as well.  Further practice with enumerable will also beneficial for you as you had some methods that you created empty arrays and then shoveled information in.  If you are doing this then there is probably an enumerable to do this.  Everything is still new to you (and even me) but I am confident you will succeed! It was great working with you!
## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up
#### Creating Your Brand

* [GitHub URL]()

The sessions were useful. Developing my story is something I will be spending a fair amount of time on. It is critical to connecting to others especially potential employers. Making a positive impact in the industry starts with every interaction. Being mindful on how I engage with and encourage others will essential to get all out of myself and my team.  

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This community is the my front line support network. Sure my family and friends are there, but first and foremost is this community. I do my best to engage with my fellow students in the classroom, at lunch, and times outside of Turing. We are a group with many different interests and talents. Everyone plays a part. I enjoyed getting to know and working with other students.
