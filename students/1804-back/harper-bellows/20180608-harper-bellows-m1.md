## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module assessment. I'm repeating.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hbellows/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

Description:
The Luhn formula verifies a credit card number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This full account number must pass the following test:

from the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit
if product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).
take the sum of all the digits
if and only if the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid

Evaluation Comments:
"Don't chain methods"

#### Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hbellows/sorting_cards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

Description:
The goal of this project is to write a program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see cards, guess what the card is, and sort the cards.

The project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior.

Evaluation Comments:
* Some tests dont work due to syntax errors
* Completed up to record guess in I2
* Unnecessary use of accessor in round
* Better test names
* Check to see what you are actually asking in tests


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Functionality

- [ ] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

- [ ] 4: Completes Iteration 4 and one extension.
- [ ] 3: Completes Iteration 3
- [ ] 2: Completes Iteration 2
- [x] 1: Completes Iteration 1

* 1: Well-below expectations

#### Wizarding Bank

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hbellows/wizard_bank)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/wizarding_bank)

Gringottâ€™s has become too big to fail, so the Ministry of Magic has decided to break up this wizarding bank.

But they need, quite literally, a programming wizard to create the software to run these banks.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The most valuable part of this project was learning GIT!!!

Specifically:
* Creating a repo
* Connecting a git repo to a GitHub repo
* Updating local git with new content
* Updating GitHub with new content
* Defining, implementing and managing a remote pairing work flow
* Merge conflicts...still elusive, but getting better!

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hbellows/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

The goal of this project is to build an encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages.

Additionally, the program will need to read messages from and output them to the file system.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/archive/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This gear up was my favorite. To hear and see how far women in technology have come, was personally inspiring to me. I do not plan on doing anything differently than I have done in my prior career. I have always been very determined and I usually don't let people stand in my way.

#### Winning through Failure

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/winning_through_failure.md)

Never give up, never surrender! An affirming look at persistence, and how to recognize, accept, and move forward from failure, or even outright defeat.  I'm still working on talking about my many failures, while also working on crystalizing key "lessons learned" and how to best apply those lessons to current struggles.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

* SAB Baby! This should cover it, right? J/K

* Even though 1804 was very divided and competitive, I felt I was successful at bridging some of the divides between the cliques.  The Echoes were hard to break through to, and while none provided support or help, I was able to eventually get them to invite the Foxtrots to one happy hour!
