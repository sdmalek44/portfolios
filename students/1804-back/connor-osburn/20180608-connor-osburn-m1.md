## A: End of Module Assessment

 Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here are the projects I completed individually. I am proud of them all in
different ways.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letsdothis64/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

I recreated the game mastermind with a REPL interface

Make sure your naming follows convention
attr_readers/writers should be the first thing in the class
Starting state should be set as arguments to initialize, not as methods
opportunities to refactor in mastermind.rb. Move logical chunks of code into their own methods
Some lines call too many methods i.e. 4 or 5 method calls
Testing random should also test that the colors are right
prefer enumerable over loops and counters
Don't transpose expected and actual

4. Functionality: 3

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letsdothis64/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night)

I created a binary search tree to sort movies and scores.

Any time you're saying if ..., then return a boolean, there's an opportunity for a refactor

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letsdothis64/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

I created the classic game "Battleship" with a repl interface

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Here are my group projects

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letsdothis64/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

We made a tree for autocomplete purposes

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

I think initially, my intent was to come to Turing and slam through everything
despite my stress levels. This lesson taught me to moderate and recognize signs of
stress. Now I keep time for outside hobbies.

#### Debugging

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

I learned that I might have an implicit position of power in our current society.
While some people may not realize it, just circumstances of their birth gives
them an advantage. While in some situations, like mental health, I may not have
all of the privelege, but with race and gender I might need to understand
my privelege and act accordingly.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried to make friends as much as I could. I joined the machine learning
posse, which exposed me to people outside of my mod.
