## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

These are the three individual projects I did. I definitely had to learn by failing here.

#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtrtj/credit_check)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

Write a program that checks the validity of a credit card number using the Luhn Algorithm.

No evaluation posted.

I think I did a good job re-writing this with TDD after figuring it out with one big method.
#### Sorting Cards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtrtj/SortingCards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

Write a program that makes a guessing game using a deck of cards.

evaluation notes:
* Some confusion around methods and ivars
* Partially completed I2
evaluation score : 1

This project really threw me for a loop but I think in failing at it, I learned more than I realized at the time.
#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jtrtj/battle_ship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Use ruby to build an implementation of the board-game Battleship that is playable through the terminal.

No evaluation posted.

I did not end up with a playable game but I learned a lot about building very small classes and making them work with each other. My mentor and I are working on a playable version.
## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Enigma
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcolling/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Create a program that can encrypt and decrypt messages from text files. It also includes a crack.

evaluation notes:
* Output text is not dynamic
* Crack does not work
* 25 tests, 30 assertions, 100 percent coverage
* Overabundance of instance variables
* Some methods are too long

evaluation score: 2

feedback from Angi:

* John, I couldn't have asked for a better project partner. I appreciate your patience and your endurance with this project. I loved that we were able to collaborate, even when we did not agree on ways to tackle certain aspects of the project. I like that we both have similar working styles, in that we took the time to go outside occasionally to see the light. I would never have realized how much I would have come to appreciate Slice works and 7/11. The work and time we put into this project really paid off, and we submitted quality code(for a two-week programmer), and a project we could both be proud of. Great job code buddy! John, you have a methodical, detailed approach to coding. I really believe this is because you are so creative and artistic. You are able to look at projects in a way that I am unable too, I believe this is why we worked so well together. I feel at times you can be really hard on yourself, and can get frustrated on how to properly articulate your thoughts, and then execute them into quality code. My suggestion to you is to remember that "code is free", and that it is "ok to fail". Just start typing out ideas you have, and it is ok to have to go back and refactor or delete methods. This concept was the hardest for me to implement myself. We often evaluate our worth by how well we complete projects when really it is the paths we take to get to the completion that really matters. I believe we both learned a lot from this project, it was a worthwhile experience in both programming and collaboration.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MLuce/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/black_thursday)

A business is only as smart as its data. Letâ€™s build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This session taught me a lot about how I personally deal with stress. I didn't know that stress can also bring you down in the way that I often feel. Using the tips outlined (Listening to aggressive music and physically engaging my body) I have successfully brought my mood up during stressful moments each day. I also started meditating with HeadSpace again after this lecture.
#### Code 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

This was a good session because it gave the opportunity for me to discuss a problem in the tech industry with a group of other students at Turing. We discussed how even Turing fails at creating a diverse community sometimes. We also talked about the pros and cons of exposing young children to so much screen time and "coding".
#### Biohacking
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/biohacking.md)

What ended up being most interesting about this topic was what everyone who attended and the presenters thought biohacking was. It ranged from dieting to control your body to physically altering your body with technology to gain abilities. Each of the four presenters were very engaging when presenting their version of what biohacking can be. There was a lot of engagement with the attendees when we were asked to look up and discuss anything related biohacking on the internet.
## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Mostly by be-friending classmates and supporting each other. Picking up trash and recycling around the basement on the weekend.
