# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

I began this module with intention of improving upon and refining my professional workflow, expanding my
knowledge of other languages and frameworks, and, of course, looking for a job.

Learning Javascript.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Knex as an ORM can be very annoying in the way that it deals with raw sql string interpolation. During the assesment though, my biggest difficulty was forgetting to pass the done variable into the anonymous function in my mocha test. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I very much enjoyed having an entire day to work through a series of problems at a more relaxed pace(after fixing very annoying test suite errors)

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I was able to isolate the problem by breaking it down into the various dependent componenets, and then examining those components step at a time.

* What did you learn?
A seemingly solid understanding of JS, Express, and Knex fundamentals.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

pass

* What was your biggest challenge?
I felt very comfortable in a professional interview environment.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I very much enjoy having to think on my feet and answer questions about complex techincal topics

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
N/A

* What did you learn?
I became even more comfortable in an interview environment


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
The greatest techincal challenge in completing QS was also my greatest joy, and that was trying to deeply understand what the intended use and underlying philosophy of each language/framework was.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Researching and pulling apart example/existing code which was written in those frameworks (ExpressJS and Phoenix)

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Learning that I really did enjoy elixir.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Concurrent databse connections, concurrent process manipulation, basic functional programming.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
I feel fairly comfortable with my technical approach. I hope to enter an environment soon which will force me to grow my technical approach further

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
N/A

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Finding a way to elegantly abstract a common block of code.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
My recent research in metaprogramming, and block handling in ruby led me to use the yield command and work with a block of code to abstract a controller method.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
yield has been a command which I have been searching for quite some time to abstract code, so finding was very exciting.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
yield method, 418 status code

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
Homebrew

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Taking apart the core homebrew code base, and finding exactly where I would need to look to begin working.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Searching for the definition of the command in question throughout the code base, and then following the commands options, until i found the command in question.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I really enjoyed working on such a large and well done code base.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
deep brew commands, options handling for cli integration 

## Feedback
What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
My most meaningful feedback during Mod 4 was regarding the importance of mentorship and personal connection in regards to professional development. I have, and will continue to try, to make those important connections.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
Figuring out a way to move beyond the expectation of a stale and arduous gear up, and to actually make the time allotted into a meaningful experiences for all those involved.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
I represented my cohort during a tense series of communications surrounding the changes to the mod 4 capstone projects. I hope I did an adequate job.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Solid and consistent communication, troubleshooting, solid workflow.

## Professional Development
