## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

There have been many surprising accomplishments for me this mod, but my favorite was working with the Jeremiah and Marika on Nurish. The idea for this application has been an idea of mine before I joined Turing. I know a lot of dietitians have struggled with looking up tube feeding formulas for patients which can cause a lot of frustration for the patient because it can take a lot of time to look up all this information in multiple books. My mentors have encouraged me to do this project since Mod 2, and again in Mod 3 but I was always too intimated to do it because I knew it was not the “sexist” app idea. Now that our MVP has been created and all of the PDF data has been seeded I realized how useful this is in the real world and that this is actual data that dietitians in any enteral nutrition field can utilize.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
As the only back-end dev on this team I realized how hard it was to keep up with another front-end team and the value of communication it takes to build what they need. After 3 days of scrapping all the data and getting all the data seeded in the database, we realized that JSON object needed to be structured differently. This was a huge struggle for me because I knew that I I had to redesign the tables and make sure all the tests would pass. After having this experience I now understand the importance of planning out all the endpoints, and how the JSON object needs to be designed for the front-end.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

A trait that I have that separates me from the rest of my peers is my background as a healthcare professional. I know from experience that working in the health care industry can feel a bit like stepping back in time. There is PII data that is imperative to keep secure, not to mention HIPPA regulations that all employees in the healthcare industry must be trained in. Because I have this knowledge and background I know that securing data is the most important aspect when working with any code base.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?


During this capstone project, I not only realized the importance of communication and a well-organized API design, but I also realized that working as a software developer in the healthcare industry may not be the industry that I’d like to start my career in. Pulling all of that data was the hardest part of make Nurish. It caused the progress of this application to be very delayed and made me realized that working in this industry may be a bit too slow pace after going through Turing.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

This mod taught me how to connect the back-end application to a front-end application and how to be mindful when creating a back-end. I realize this was a new idea for Turing to have front-end work with the back-end. I’m very glad I got experience because I will be working on a team that will have bumps in the road and how I handle those bumps will be extremely important.
