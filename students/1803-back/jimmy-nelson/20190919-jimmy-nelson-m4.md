# Jimmy Nelson - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to refine my development process, to learn new technologies that will help me while working with code in production, to become acquainted with new languages and frameworks, and to add polish to my resume and cover letter writing skills. I have been very successful in cementing excellent processes and habits that will enable me to continue to learn and grow as a developer.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
#### PASS

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  * I thought that my solution for iteration 1 would be easily transferable to iteration 2, but because of the way that the JSON was expected to be returned in iteration 2, I actually could not build on my previous solution. It took me a while of tinkering with Promises to realize that I needed to change tacks.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  * I liked that the challenge took a project that we had previously worked on and required us to embellish it with new functionality. The deeper dive into constructing custom JSON in Express gave me a new appreciation for Rails serializers.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  * Since I had gotten it into my head that the second solution could be built on to  the first solution, it took me moving on to the third iteration and allowing some time to pass for me to get some clarity.

* What did you learn?

  * I learned the value of giving yourself some space and time away from a specific problem that is defying you. When you get hung up on something, continuing to bang your head against it usually does not provide you the solution.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

#### Pass

* What was your biggest challenge?

  * I had a hard time expressing what non-required technologies I have become interested in since Turing started.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  * It made me reflect on coding as a much larger thing than can possibly taught or learned in 7 months. Having now been asked that question I am confident that I will be able to answer it more readily in the future.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  * In the moment I decided to take as long as I needed to think of something instead of simply getting deterred and saying that I didn't know. Ultimately I said that Jquery and DOM manipulation were very interesting to me. In the future I will have an answer ready regarding background workers.

* What did you learn?

  * I became aware of something that it is easy to lose sight of when you are nervous and in an interview that will determine whether you get the job or not--that is, that your interviewer is also just a human trying to find out about you. They are not trying to freak you out or make you feel bad. It is a liberating realization.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  * My biggest challenge with Quantified Self was deploying my Django App to Heroku with a Postgres database.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  * My solution to that challenge was to read the heroku/django docs and to otherwise look for people solving the same problem as me on the internet.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  * Feeling more comfortable with adapting to new technologies has been very rewarding. I feel like those experiences made me a wiser developer who can quickly diagnose possible causes to any unexpected error in a codebase.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  * I learned about CORS and how to solve those issues in multiple frameworks.
  * I learned about asynchronous calls in Javascript and how to properly handle Promises
  * I learned how to set up an Express app so that it is split into MVC components.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

  * I think the main thing I would change about my technical approach is to vet the resources available to me more thoroughly before diving into one tutorial too deeply. I had an issue with one of the Django tutorials where they wound up going into some add-on features to streamline the process of making an API. This may have been useful to some people, but it wasn't exactly the experience I was looking for.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  * I think our biggest technical challenge was figuring out a way to keep our code DRY while adding new possible routes to preexisting itineraries. This felt like one of my first authentic opportunities to use inheritance within my own created classes.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  * We solved this issue by each individually considering how best to implement the feature, discussing our theories, and then diving back into individual exploration of the topic. Our brainstorming conversations are what led to the idea of setting up one class to inherit from the other.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  * I really enjoyed taking an idea of our own devising, establishing the MVP for that idea and then taking any and all routes necessary to get to that MVP. The route we wound up taking isn't the one we thought we would have to take or be able to take, but it's the one that presented itself as the most viable solution. Being open to different avenues of attack and to changing the approach in the middle after doing some more research was a very valuable learning experience.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  * I learned how to set up cron jobs on production code using an open-source sidekiq extension called scheduler.
  * I solidified my understanding of Travis CI and learned techniques to address compatibility and setup issues that can occur throughout your project as you make changes to the project's dependencies.
  * I refamiliarized myself with rebasing and found that it worked much better on this project than it had the last time I was in a group, because we all had developed much more focused and intentional workflow patterns. We also were able to communicate more effectively through project set up on the waffleboard and through appropriate commenting and code review on GitHub.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

  * I contributed to WikiEduDashboard

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

  * Setting up tests to properly replicate all records that are dependent on each other proved to be most difficult. Understanding the complexity of the schema and the exact desired behavior were both difficult aspects of writing the test and the implementation code.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

  * Ultimately, after several hours spent laboring over the code, I resolved to submit a WIP pull request showing the current state of the test and where I was getting stuck.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

  * It was really interesting to me to see just how elaborate of a Rails Monolith you can create and all of the potential within a single app.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

  * I was able to familiarize myself with setting up MySQL and cassandra.
  * I learned about haml and how it can help keep your view code very clean and minimalistic.
  * I was able to experience the real value of WIP pull requests. Working in small code bases where everyone knows everyone and can get on slack with each other, I had never really before appreciated how a WIP with a good explanation of the problem can be very helpful in identifying where the code is not working correctly.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

  * I learned that in terms of learning and growing as a developer, it can be much more beneficial to focus on a single technology and get really good at that one technology before moving on to something else.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

  * My team was very good and we worked together well. By breaking up the class into small groups with rotations we were able to effectively break up the hour-plus of time into manageable chunks that we were able to keep very engaging for the people participating. We got lots of great feedback in our gear up channel from our participants and it felt good to read those comments. I enjoyed it a lot, and I think that I would recommend to future mod4 students, as someone who has been in good gear ups and mediocre gear ups, that in terms of planning it seems to make a lot of sense to break up the time into a few different sections that are all related and make each member of the gear up planning group responsible for figuring out how to keep their section engaging.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

  * I talked with multiple backend mod 3 students about their personal projects in order to give any advice I could and to allow them to come to a greater understanding of their projects through describing their problems and their proposed solutions to me. Giving back to the community is very important at Turing because we are ultimately a pretty small group of people all trying to do a very hard thing, and it will always work better and students will learn more and be happier if they feel like everyone is supportive and cares about them and their success.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

  * I think particularly this mod I have refined some excellent development habits and processes. I think having a great, descriptive, reliable git workflow with corresponding project planning board to match is an amazing way to stay focused and make it easy not only to solve problems but to retroactively diagnose where issues may have occurred during the problem solving process.
  * I have developed really strong project planning skills and the communication skills to match. I am able to effectively and efficiently communicate with my teammates to convey ideas about technical topics and my proposed solutions to group-wide roadblocks.
  * Having been able to build out an API in two new frameworks in two weeks gave me the confidence that I could pick up any language and framework that I need over the course of my career. Having seen how inherently similar a lot of the problems and tools are I am not afraid of any tech stack because I know where to find the resources that will help me master any new language relatively quickly.
