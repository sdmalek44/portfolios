# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What did you want to focus on this inning? What did you hope to accomplish by graduation?

- Acquiring expert knowledge of JavaScript
- Using that knowledge to build APIs using technologies like NodeJS and ExpressJS
- Learning at least one new language
- Building a full-stack application

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

*Pass*

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
By far, seeding databases and cleaning up databases using non-blocking ORMs like Knex. Making sure that asynchrnous functions ran in the order that was necessary for the database not to error out was certainly a challenge.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I enjoyed how much I had to dig into the inner-workings of asynchronous functions and PostgreSQL to get this to work.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I researched and stepped the problem out, succeeding first in the smallest porition of the desired result and then working one step at a time to make sure everything was built properly.

* What did you learn?
Moderate/Expert understanding of JavaScript as a backend technology.

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

*Pass*

* What was your biggest challenge?
Describing the HTTP request/response cycle in non-abstract terms. I found that I resorted to high-level overviews when I could've done better using technical language and dug into specifics a bit more.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked that it revealed to me a small gap in my understanding of a core part of my learning. I liked that it led me to a deeper understanding of the HTTP request/response cycle as well.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I took time after the technical assessment to talk it out with my instructor and thought through my answer for next time based on their feedback.

* What did you learn?
I learned that I can sometimes resort to high level overviews as a coping mechanism for small gaps in udnerstanding. I can identify this now and address it when necessary.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
My biggest technical challenge was actually a tie between operating on a database asynchronously using NodeJS ORMs like Knex, and learning functional programming (Elixir/Phoenix). The latter, specifically how to test in that language. Once I knew how to test for both of these challenges though, everything fell into place.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Small steps. When a challenge is too large to address all at once, it means I need to narrow down my expectation to the smallest possible portion, create some type of test or other expectation to gauge when I've successfully accomplished that goal, do research, and then implement.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked learning more about functional programming and seeing the design of something familiar like RESTful APIs from the perspective of an entirely different programming paradigm.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

- Asynchronous database operations
- Functional programming
- Using ES6/ES7 syntax to handle asynchronous functionality. My favorite specifically was async/await.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
To be entirely honest, I am very comfortable with my technical approach. To me this means that it may be worth temporarily removing one tool, to see how I fill the gap. I'm not sure what tool this would be; I think I would want a third-party to challenge me in that way.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
The initial conceptualization and making sure that our data interchange was synonymous between our frontend interface and the backend API was certainyl a challenge and a crucial one at that.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
We made sure to whiteboard in the beginning to make sure our JSON shapes were correct and as we moved into working the project, we made sure to document our endpoints and keep that documentation up to date so we could always be on the same page.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked being able to build a solid foundation on the backend early and then accommodate the frontend interface as needed as it started to utilize the API. The challenege of being on call to make sure that our API was always functioning as needed was a great experience.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
During this challenge I further reinforced how to use begin/rescue to make sure I am sending proper error messages. I was also able to abstract that by learning how to use yield blocks - we created an application controller method to help with our exception handling then. I also learned how to use bcrypt ina pure Ruby context and handroll its matching.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
freeCodeCamp's guide repo: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Setting up the code base, and then actually tracking down the issue in the correct repository/file.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
freeCodeCamp's contribution documentation and guidelines were phenomenal. Following their inxtructions and doing some troubleshooting on a particularly troublesome versioning issue with a node package was sufficient.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I loved contributing to a code base that was owned by people I do not know. Their kindness and willingness to assist was wuite encouraging.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- Independent updating of node package versions
- I learned some more about html character entities for making unicode characters
- I learned more about ::before pseudo elements

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
Communicate challenges and issues arising with work or personal life immediately with instructor staff.

One fantastic piece of feedback I received was about documentation. My first iteration of Quantified Self was lacking in the realm of documentation an d my instructor admonished me to do better and provided some reasons as to why. I took those to heart and having solid documentation in the capstone was a huge success for our team's communication between the backend and the frontend.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

It was interesting being the one organizing a Mod4-led gear up after having been through 2 - 3 of these already. I, frankly, was having a hard time being enthusiastic about the process having seen some of the results previously and I was worried that it would be something I and possibly my group would not put effort into.

However, we all got excited about our Pay It Forward topic. There was origami, recorder choirs, and triangular rubix cubes and it was all sorts of fun. It was still challenging to get people engaged; however, I feel that we certainly did get some people engaged in the process and that our point was heard. In the end, I believe it was fun and beneficial. I know it was for me.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I began this inning quite strong in pairing with students from other Mods. I was excited to help out and when I got busy later, I missed having the same time to commit to that. I am happy that it looks like I will be around Turing to help out in the coming couple of months!

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

- Highly organized and optimized team processes. I feel this is crucial to my working well with a team/company.
- Test-Driven Development. Since Mod1 this is how I've designed my code. I consider this a core part of my development process as a software engineer.
- Teamwork and communication. Turing has taught me how to be a useful and kind teammate. I was afraid of collaboration prior to Turing. Now I seek it out.

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
