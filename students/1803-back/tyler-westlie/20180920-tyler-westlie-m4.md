## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I think my biggest achievement the module has been getting comfortable making a REST API in Go. The language is quite different from  Ruby and JavaScript what I'm used to but I was able to pick up the important pieces and build an application in a very short period of time. I also found configuring testing in Go was particularly challenging. After this experience I'm fairly confident that I will be able to TDD almost any other application I come across in the future.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
I was challenged with the capstone project this module. Building a Rails API was pretty straight forward, and did not struggle with the design and implementation of the endpoints. The part I found challenging was working with an individual from another discipline. I found it particularly challenging to predict exactly what would work on the front end with their fetch calls. This helped me design more verbose error messages for the endpoints I wrote.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
My patiences when it comes to troubleshooting problems. When one  of my cohort-mates or myself don't understand something, I don't have to understand everything involved with the problem. I've learned at Turing to be comfortable not knowing the answer.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I think it gave me the confidence to be able to work outside of what I learned in the backend program at Turing, even potentially working in frontend code. I think doing a project with Node.js made me more comfortable in JavaScript and I could definitely apply some of those skills on the frontend. Even with our capstone I was able to make a component in React and effectively make a fetch call to my own backend.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Empathy for my users and fellow developers. With my background in mental health empathy has been a central ability in my life. I didn't come to Turing thinking that it would be the most important take away. To the Turing grads that embrace this lesson from Turing, I think it will really make them shine in the workforce.
