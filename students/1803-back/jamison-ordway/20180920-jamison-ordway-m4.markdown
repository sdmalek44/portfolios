# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

Networking/community involvement, algorithmic thinking & logic, present a great capstone project.

## JS Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Configuration for an Express app, learning how to properly use JS promises, syntax for raw SQL within knex.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Seeing the real world example of how the same implementation of endpoints can be acheived with a different interface.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

I paired with others in my cohort to understand setup and configuration, and returned to JS curriculum for syntax assistance.

* What did you learn?

Familiarity with JavaScript, knex, and Node. Improved my knowledge about asynchronous functions and promisies. 

## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
pass

* What was your biggest challenge?

Keeping my nerves under control and articulating details for the response portion of the HTTP request/response cycle.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Having some confidence about technical topics I've studied while at Turing.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Used analogies to describe functionality when I couldn't remember exact technical terms. Offered to look into more technical description.

* What did you learn?

How to think of similar talking points under pressure.


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Express configuration, Python file structure differences.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Pairing and research. I asked some Python questions at an Ask a Dev meetup as well.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Trying out a new language and framework (Python/Django).

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

JS promises, how to write better documentation, difference between Rails Views and Django Templates

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I would have spent more time researching the ecosystem of an express app.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

N/A -- solo project

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Remaining agile on a large team and keeping up with frequency of changes.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Frequent Slack check-ins and use of Waffle.io

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Getting to build out the back end of a project while the front end is being built at the same time by team mates.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Practice consuming Google directions API, configuring Travis CI, and learned more about CORS for connecting decoupled apps.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?

Refuge Restrooms

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Understanding what Heroku instructions meant (since Heroku instructions were the only ones provided by repo owners)

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Googled and asked project owners clarifying questions

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Getting to work on a real-world project 

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Setting up environment, GitHub open source etiquette, learned about S3 buckets

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

My PD coach recommended that I revisit the Ruby docs and become more familiar with common methods, which I have done and will continue to do as part of my daily coding practice.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

It was challenging to guide conversations in directions that weren't repetitive, and the video material we selected wasn't as engaging as I would have liked. However, it was really rewarding to see people share their experiences with each other.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

I paired with students in other mods, and I think that this is important for both participants. As a mod 4 student, reviewing mod 3 and mod 1 concepts was very helpful as a refresher, but it's also good practice for working with people at various skill levels in future workplaces.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

Writing detailed documentation, taking notes/diagrams about project challenges and goals before starting to code, good Git workflow.


## Professional Development

* 30 Day Plan:

* Professional Story:
During my career as a musician and an educator, my coding hobby grew into a love of programming. I chose to improve my software engineering skills at Turing School, because I was drawn to their mission and values. Though I certainly accomplished my goal of obtaining relevant technical knowledge, attending Turing has also been instrumental to refining my general thought process and my collaborative skills. I have transitioned into the tech industry so that I can wake up each day excited to solve interesting problems.  My personal background in music and activism, combined with my professional background in youth leadership, has led me to seek a work environment which involves restoration, creativity, and teamwork.
