# Justine Troyke - M4 Portfolio

## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Feeling a certain amount of validity as a developer. Near the end of this module I feel like I finally got comfortable with new problems and tackling programming challenges I had no familiarity with. I reached a point in which I felt a certain confidence in my abilities as a programmer. To use the basic principles I know, documentation and research to jump into the process of trial and error to reach a goal or solve a problem.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Quantified self and taking on the recreation of a project in different languages. I really struggled with submerging into a new
language/framework, finding the right tools, de-buggers and making the correlation to what I knew in Ruby/Rails vs that new language.
I learned that I could make it through that struggle by getting to know my debugging and testing tools By taking the smallest steps possible towards the test I was trying to pass.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I was excited that I was able to create an idea that both a frontend and backend were interested in creating. I was able to pitch the idea, get buy in and collectively work towards a fun product. When we hit a major road block due to a deprecated API, I was able to create a work around by building a web scraper. It was something I knew little about but by being pushed to deliver for a team that got behind my idea I was able to figure out how to get it working well enough for MVP, and also learned a lot of ways to not build a web scraper when having to mimic logging in.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
It solidified my desire and choice to pursue backend. I don't particularly like or shine when it comes to frontend programming or design however I know that if I had to I could do it.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Perseverance. Through any struggle or problem, you can take small steps to work slowly through a problem in order to arrive at minimum solution and then work to make that better. Preserver until you make it work, then make it better.
