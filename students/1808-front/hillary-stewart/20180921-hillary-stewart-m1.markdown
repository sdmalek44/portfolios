##### Partner Feedback
I loved how organized Hillary was.  She was also an excellent communicator, both with how she likes to work and what she hoped to achieve. She was tenacious when we encountered a hurdle and was great at implementing techniques/ideas gleaned from research. It is possible that our mutual desire to work together hindered our progress. We took time to do some wireframe and CSS together on the first day of the project. While I found this helpful because it solidified our partnership, I think that in future projects it might be beneficial to separate certain aspects of the work that could be done individually. This might help save some time.

##### Partner Feedback

You were hard-working and patient. I really appreciated how willing to you were to put time into this project. At the beginning of the pairing you mentioned that you were nervous to work with me because of my javascript knowledge and that you were afraid of getting left behind. By the end of the project, I was very impressed with how much you picked up and the time you spent working at and figuring out all of the logic in the final product. Nice work! I think where we could have done better was splitting up the javascript work. I ultimately wrote most of functions and I think that inhibited your learning to an extent. At the time, we may have thought that talking through each function I wrote multiple times was enough, but I think there was a better way. Specifically, we should have had you working on features by yourself and then coming to me if you ran into issues. This is the approach my current partner and I are taking and they have told me that it's working super well for them! While I do think the strategy we took was mainly driven by myself, I do think you could have asked for more input or specifically to work on a feature. I'd encourage claiming work in this way should you have another pairing with someone who might take off a little too quickly (like myself) in the future.  I really enjoyed working with you, keep up the positivity and motivation!

I brought Habit Douhgnuts to the mythical creatures party that two classmates organized. Being a SAB rep, I suggested having a wheel of prizes for part of the code fair.
