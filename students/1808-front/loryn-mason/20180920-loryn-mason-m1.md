# Loryn Mason - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Overall I set out to learn as much as possible, and truly understand the material. Before mod 1 I felt like I a decent understanding of html and CSS, so I really wanted to build on my knowledge and be able to build responsize websites. Whereas with JavaScript I knew also most nothing going in. I definitely struggled with JavaScript mid mod, but I keep pushing and did as much reps as possible. Now I have a good handle on mod 1 JavaScript foundations.

I built a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100, or can chose their own range of numbers. There is an input field for guessing the number, a button for submitting a guess, a button for clearing the input field, a button that resets the game. when the user submits a guess it display the user’s most recent guess and display results and feedback:
If their guess is too high, it should display: “That is too high”
If their guess is too low, it should display: “That is too low”
If the guess is correct, it should display: “BOOM!”

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Before week 5 Ashley and I organized a Mythical Creatures study party complete with donuts. We walked through the last five mythical creatures help us and others understand them.Throughout the mod whenever possible I offered to help people with their CSS, which is my strong suit. I also made it a point to check in with people and see how they were doing, especially with self care.
