# Jake Lauer - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I sought out to become comfortable with HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and Git by the end of the mod. I 
also wanted to make solid connections with as many of my classmates as possible. By the end of the module, I 
acheived all my technical goals and had a lot of fun working with and hanging out with more of my classmates than I 
thought I would!

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jakelauer27/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Assignment was to create a webapp where users could submit ideas, sort them, and rank them.

`Evalulation Comments`

- can add tags
- really nicely done UI! A couple spots to polish: on the sticky header, have the product name stay visible as well as the  tags, and mobile have the tags be in a menu that can be collapsed so they don't hie all your cards!
- one function handles upvote and downvote
- make sure you both own the full codebase -- aim for equal contributions to JS and CSS
- really, really well done!

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

As an SAB rep this mod I helped lead retros every Friday and catalyze any desired facility and teaching changes that my mod voiced.
I also was a go-to resource for many of my classmates when they were struggling with a technical problem. My positive attitude and willingness
to help I beleive has contributed to class morale and cohesion. Outside of the classroom, I am a Thursday Brothers regular, allowing me to foster 
connections with those in other mods. I hope to continue to build relationships with other mods in order to grow the sense of communitity within Turing.
