# Kylie Stanley - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming to Turing, I knew very little about software or code in general. I set out to gain a good foundational knowledge of Javascript and general Web Development. Turing exceeded my expectations in that area. I had no idea I would also learn about things like accessibility, test driven development, and how color and font choices make huge impacts on how others view your work.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I had a lot of fun overall with all of the individual projects. The challenge of getting a little better at Grid and layouts with each individual comp was fun, and it was cool to see how each individual made the project their own. I believe I improved a lot over the course of the six weeks and went from knowing nothing, to creating a project with nearly 1,000 lines of CSS. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KylieStanley/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This challenge was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The user's most recent guess should be displayed as well as let them know whether it was too high or low. There was also inputs to allow the user to choose their own min/max. Knowing where to start with this was difficult since it was the first project with JavaScript, but I am really proud that I was able to complete it and everything functioned as expected. 

#### Evaluation Comments

Clean UI/UI - just be sure to replicate the comp exactly unless given creative liberty
Nice job using semantic HTML
Avoid in-line JS in HTML - keep HTML, CSS, JS separated
Hooray for alphabetized declarations in CSS!!! Look into SMACSS for organizing styles
Err on the side of classes before IDs - avoids IDs in CSS
Nice job with naming in JS - easy to follow
Love the spinning text functionality when you win!

#### Static Comp 1

This project provided a layout, with creative liberty only when resized. It was the first opportunity to experiment with Grid and trying to figure out how to rearrange the boxes was pretty tricky. Aside from a few issues with sizing and spacing of things, I am really happy with how it turned out.

#### Evaluation Comments

Watch margins and spacing so images and text do not crowd each other. Make sure images do not crop awkwardly.

#### Static Comp 2

Similar to Comp 1, a layout was provided with creative liberties for color, images, and fonts. This project built on the last, with more complexity of the components. I was also pretty happy with how this project turned out. My fonts were definitely a little small and crowded on the larger monitor, but I thought I did well recreating the layout and getting my margins to be more consistent.

#### Evaluation Comments

Text a little crowded - check line heights
Height of boxes moving when squished, try to keep consistency

#### Static Comp 3

This project was exactly as the last two static comps, but much more complex. This project involved multiple grids and flex containers, as well as multiple areas of navigation. I am overall happy with how mine turned out, but know a lot of refining could be done. It seemed like there were never-ending possibilities of small things to fix. It was really difficult to layout everything out and ensure that it would be easy to rearrange when resizing. I ended up having to re-grid a few components so in the future, better planning could help that.

#### Evaluation Comments

Make sure everything looks good on large screens as well, some issues with overlapping.
Could change layout for right-side/bottom social media area
Great use of semantic HTML and organizational comments in CSS
Good use of aria labels and alt tags for images


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I thought all of my paired projects went really well. As an introvert, I was unsure of trying to create a project with someone, but all of my partners were really great. It was interesting seeing how thought processes differed between each of us and helpful to be able to bounce ideas of one another.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KylieStanley/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is an application in which the user has two input fields, Bookmark title and URL. After entering data into inputs on the left, the data would be appended to the right side. We also had to add buttons to mark bookmarks as "read", remove bookmarks, and clear all read bookmarks. As the first paired project, I think we executed this very well, and I was able to get a first look at CSS Grid. My partner was definitely more advanced in JavaScript, so I was a little disappointed that I didn't feel like I contributed much in that aspect after it was complete.

#### Evaluation Comments

I love how many commits ya'll have. Now work on creating more branches! =)
Nice work on matching the comp. Couple things when the screen gets smaller but sounds like ya'll had that fixed on another branch.
Maybe find a different color that goes on the outside of the app
Stay away from nested divs (especially for the error section, might want to add a role)
Maybe find another html element than footer
If it is only for styling purposes, and it isn't a link, use a button for the read and delete elements
Good work on organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
Some places where we could minimize the styles and bring it back either using grouping or using a class in multiple places
Some places where there are some interesting uses of positioning in a hacky fix (might be a hint to find another way to control the elements)
Nice work organizing global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
Be consistent in either using named functions or anonymous functions
Nice use of a while loop
I like that you're already experimenting with ternaries and using expressions that evaluate to true or false instead of using if/else statements for the disabled
Keep working on using less global variables

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KylieStanley/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox was a project in which the user input data into two fields, title and body. This would append their idea below, with options to upvote, downvote, and delete ideas. The content was editable and could be filtered. This was made more difficult by having everything update in local storage as well. I had a lot of fun on this because Eric was a fantastic partner. Using a constructor function and manipulating it's data within the dom and local storage was challenging. I am proud that we were able to get most of the local storage aspects working prior to the actual lesson.

#### Evaluation Comments

Nice work creating more commits and having descriptive messages
Continue to keep creating more branches and have specific names for each branch
Might add more spacing between buttons
Really good attention to detail and nice UX/UI
Nice work with keeping a clean html structure and using aria-labels
Can also add aria-label to button inside of form
Nice work with organization and alphabetizing css properties
Good work grouping some styles and using one class for multiple items
Be careful using vh when looking at responsiveness. Practice not only squishing it horizontally but also vertically
Cheers for no global variables!
Nice work using a constructor function for your Ideas
Clear names for your functions
For your refactor, see if you can store all of the ideas in localstorage with one key and a value of an array
Careful not to use nested if/else statements
See if you can put your qualities inside of an array and go through the qualities by index
For your search functionality, instead of doing display none, see if you can remove the ideas (the elements are still on the DOM even if they have display none)

#### 2DoBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KylieStanley/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project took an existing IdeaBox which we then had to pivot to 2DoBox. The specifications were similar to IdeaBox, with additional options to complete tasks, filter by importance and remove completed items. We originally didn't think this was going to be extremely difficult, but figuring out where to start was pretty tough. We finished all phases and I think this really solidified a lot of concepts such as objects and working with data in arrays. I enjoyed this project because it was more like a real life scenario where you are working in an existing codebase that is foreign and may not even function correctly.

#### Evaluation Comments

nice UI, on mobile filter buttons should be same width as cards and inputs for consistency
HTML could use a little bit of a polish pass
JS has opportunities for additional refactor and DRY-ing up of code
good shared ownership of codebase, you are both able to speak to what it's doing and the thought process that went into it

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was nervous in moving to a new state with no friends, so I really wanted to make friends and form connections with everyone that I would be spending so much time with. I paired with Mod 2 students and also worked with my own cohort as much as possible. I felt pretty comfortable with mythical creatures from the start so that was a great opportunity to really reach out and help fellow classmates. Students in Mod 2 proved to be valuable resources so I hope to continue that tradition and helping the next group of Mod 1 students succeed as well.
