# Ashley Levi - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 1 I had no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, therefore, my goal was to learn as much as possible and to build a strong foundation in all three of these areas. In addition to building these technical foundations and working on my technical vocabulary, I wanted to improve upon my soft skills. These included: learning how to work and communicate with different groups of people, public speaking, and time management. Upon completing module 1, I feel that I am now competent in all of these areas.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of the module I had to work on various projects, both individual and with a partner. I gained a ton of experience and knowledge working with JavaScript/jQuery DOM manipulation, event delegation, local storage, array prototypes and organizing and structering HTML and CSS. On top of that, I was able to practice working and communicating with different types of people on difficult projects which prompted us to quickly learn and master git/github in the process.

#### Number Guesser

For this project I created a number guessing game where the user is challanged to correctly guess a randomly generated number.  The user can instantiate their own minimum and maximum number-range and then the application will generate a random number between those minimum and maximum inputs. If the user guesses correctly, the game will tell them 'BOOM!' and then the minimum range decreases by 10 and the maximum range increases by 10.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

For this project we created a bookmarking application where you can create bookmarks for all of your favorite websites. You can mark any bookmark as read and/or delete a bookmark. The application will keep a counting track of all bookmarks created and all bookmarks that are marked as read.

* [Evaluation Comments](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1808/mod-1/linked-list/theo-ashley.md)
* Feedback from Theo:
Ashley was very organized overall and drove the progress by being on-time and having a "can-do" attitude. We did a great job of spacing out work time and getting our work done early. For coaching, keep up the strong communication!

#### IdeaBox

For this project we created an application that allowed you to add all of your ideas to a list on a page. This project implemented local storage so that all of your prepended ideas persisted on the page after reloading. You can delete your ideas, search through them, edit them, and upvote or downvote the quality of each idea.

* [Evaluation Comments](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1808/mod-1/idea-box/cole-ashley.md)
* Feedback from Cole:
Ashley and I worked very well together on IdeaBox. I appreciated how she had a flexible working schedule, and was willing to meet whenever I could meet. We both had similar mindsets that we wanted to get a majority of the project done over the weekend so we would have a good start on it going into the week. Ashley is very organized and determined worker, and I appreciate that we both learned a lot during this project. I really appreciated that we alternated driving and navigating because it helped me to really understand what we were doing. One thing that we can both do to improve next time is to make sure we make our website responsive even if the directions dont say to.

#### 2DoBox

For this project we refactored someone else's code for the Ideabox bookmarking application to make it fully functional. Once we accomplished this, we pivoted to 2Dobox. This entailed adding new features to the application such as: updating the amount of upvotes or downvotes for each 2-do item, searchability by quality, buttons to mark the 2-do as completed, and storing the completed 2-dos so as to be able to uncover them at a later time.

* [Evaluation Comments](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1808/mod-1/to-do-box/ashley-matt.md)
* Feedback from Matt: 
You really helped me understand parts of Javascript that I was having difficulty with, and I received more experience actually working with you together on a project as opposed to my previous pairings where a lot of work was done separately. You also helped build my confidence when I was feeling down about my Javascript skills. This was my favorite pairing out of this Mod. I was really happy with this pairing. All I can really say is having the opportunity to drive a little more and push up my branches and commits from my side would have given me some more experience and had our repository look less one sided. Maybe in the future it would be good to push more commits from your partners computer, and split the driver navigator relationship up a little more. Otherwise great job!!!!


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have felt very connected to the Turing community throughout module 1. I often arrived to campus about an hour before classes started and stayed on campus until around 7:00pm every day. Because of this, I was able to connect with a lot of my peers and offer help to anyone in need- especially for static comp projects and mythical creatures. I also set up pairs almost every day, therefore, I was really able to connect with people in other modules and grow my network at Turing while also receiving the help and assistance I needed on assignments. On top of my general presence around campus, Loryn Mason and I were able to put together a mythical creatures study session for our module 1 peers over the weekend before finals. 

On top of that, I participated in events outside of Turing such as attending the Demo Comp at WeWork!
