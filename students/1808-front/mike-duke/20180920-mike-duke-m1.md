## Areas of Emphasis

My biggest goal for this module was to do better than i did the first time. It was important to me that i wasn't just getting farther into the specifications than i did on my previous attempt, but that my understanding was clearer. It was also important to me that i pick up as much information as possible that i missed or misunderstood my first time.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

i believe i passed the end-of-module assessment. My biggest area of weakness, in my opinion, was the final static comp, but i also feel very good about how much this version is improved over my previous attempt. I got very positive feedback from both the DOM manipulation and the mythical creatures eval, and i felt really confident about my final quiz (all green tests will do that.)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For my individual projects, i felt much more confident getting a solid base down, which allowed me to spend more time doing research on the concepts that were less evident--like CSS grid, flex positioning, and some small JS concepts in Number Guesser. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mike-duke/numberGuesser1808)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

"Clean UI/UI - just be sure to replicate the comp exactly unless given creative liberty
Use form istead of p to wrap your inputs
Nice job with organization in CSS file!
Good naming conventions with JS file - makes code easy to follow
Would have liked to see you reach for the extensions/choose your own adventure"

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

For group projects, my goal was to push my understanding farther than i had in the past, emphasizing clean-looking code and solid functionality

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lorynmason/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Build a small application for storing and displaying links for later reading.

"Nice work on commits and branches
I would be a little clearer with commit messages (using imperative tense) and more detailed branches
Good work matching the comp
Noticed things don't always stay centered vertically as it gets smaller (this will be easier once we go over flex)
On mobile view, text of cards could be a bit bigger for readability
Really clean html structure
Try adding aria labels to inputs in forms
Totally okay to add grid to the body
Nice work with organization of css and alphabetizing properties
Good work grouping css classes and finding those parts where there are repeated lines
Be careful using vw and vh especially with responisve applications
Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
Awesome work starting to use constructor functions
Nice work breaking out functions into smaller functions
Really great refactoring and keeping things readable and clean
Make sure to have event as parameter so nothing wierd happens
Implement error handling in the DOM rather than using alerts"

"HTML
Good semantic html - provide instructions with aria labels

CSS
Consider adding organizational comments

JS
DRY it up for maintainability
Consider using arrays and leveraging indices to display text ie. qualities
Consider places where you can leverage bracket notation

Git/Github
Love that you're using waffle"

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Take code from Idea Box and refactor, then pivot into a different application that records and saves tasks as a kind of to-do list.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My biggest and maybe most unexpected contribution was helping my cohort with git problems, giving advice on JS, and generally being a source of information. i even ended up running a mythical creatures session for a few hours between week 4 and week 5. i also attended one of the Try Turing sessions over lunch on a Saturday to share my experiences and answer any questions for prospective new students.
