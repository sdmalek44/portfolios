# Cole Vanacore - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing with no previous coding experience, besides the week of pre-work prior to the class. During this module, I was hoping to find out if this was something that I was interested in, and if I could be successful at coding. I really did not know what to expect in this module, as I had never been exposed to any kinds of coding before. My goal was to become proficient at Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Looking forward, I am hoping to keep up my HTML and CSS skills even though I won't be using them in mod 2. Another goal of mine was to keep up my wellness aspects such as getting enough sleep, exercising, and making sure I was taking ample breaks which definitely helped me stay focused and alert.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual project this module was the first project, Number Guesser.

#### Number Guesser

* [My Number Guesser](https://github.com/colev1/number-guesser)
* [Number Guesser Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

 The goal of this project was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The user should be told if their guess is too high, too low, or accurate. Then, the user should be able to set a range for their guess and geuss again.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This mod we worked on three group projects: Linked List, Ideabox, and 2DoBox.

#### Linked List

 Linked List was the first group project. The goal of this project was to build an application that a user can enter a name and URL of a link and have it displayed on the page. The link should be displayed and styled in a display area on the page, and have buttons that can delete and read the bookmarks.

#### IdeaBox
 IdeaBox was our second group project. The goal of this project was to create an application in which the user can input an idea with a title and body, and then change the quality of the idea. The idea should persist on the page on reload, and have the ability to be deleted.

#### 2DoBox 

 2DoBox was the third and final group project of the mod. In this we were given someone's previous IdeaBox, and had to refactor it then pivot it to show ToDos instead of ideas. The final pivot should have all the same functionalities as IdeaBox, with added functionalities such as completed task button and a filtering feature.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

From week 1, I realized that collaborating and pairing with people in the community was going to be extremely crucial to mu sucess at Turing. Throughout the mod, I often came to Turing on the weekends to do work with my peers, as well as stayed after school most days. I found that I did my best work while in the classroom. I also paired frequently with people from Mod 2, and did my best to support the Turing community. All my group project pairings were successful and enjoyable!
