# Cody Price - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out this Mod to get a solid foundation on Javascript, as well as improve my CSS/HTML skills. Prior to turing I was especially nervous about javascript considering the pace at which Eloquent Javascript was taught at. I also wanted to learn some ins and outs of the software industry as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects to me were the most fun in that I only was accountable to myself and could work more at my own pace and experiment more. This is the area where I feel like I got to expand my skills outside of lectures and add them to my skillset.

#### Number-Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cody-Price/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

-Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
-Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).

* Good work on user experience and UI
  * Maybe add a little more spacing between elements so they don't get too cramped
* Good structure and spacing of HTML
  * I would remove commented out lines in the future for evals
  * Use more semantic tags instead of html
  * Keep onclick handlers in your javascript instead of HTML
* Use more classes instead of IDs
  * Keeps IDs on forms and inputs
* Good use of grouping for styles
  * Keep text-align on text elements only, not sections or divs
  * Experiment more with using margins and paddings instead of position relative for positioning
* Pay attention to organization of properties (either alphabetically or by similar types)
* Good organization with global variables 
  * Nice use of isNan function
  * I love the statusUpdate function.  Good use of finding repeated functionality and drying it up
  * Stay away from returning multiple things in a function (many of the situations i saw you actually do not need to return something.  Assigning the innerText a value will work)
  * Keep variables in functions a little more locally scoped instead of reassigning your querySelectors (wierd things can happen when doing this)
  * Continue to find more situations where you can break out functionality (keep functions single responsibility)

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

#### Static-comp-1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cody-Price/cp-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

-Recreate a portfolio site with a grid layout.

*Good spacing between text and buttons.
*Remember to choose color pallets that make sense.
*Good contrasts between adjescent sections.
*Main image becomes stretched easily.
*Dont take liberty with the button layout.
*margins should be consistent on page.

#### Static-comp-2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cody-Price/cp-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

-Recreate a responsive site with a grid/flex layout.

*Use overlays.
*Busy things can be included (i.e. background of site) but maybe more as an easter egg.

#### Static-comp-3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cody-Price/cp-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

-Recreate a complex resume site that is responsive to any screen size utilizing all the tools you have learned in mod-1.

*Utilize pointer cursor on buttons
*Ensure attention to detail on font weights
*A bit of crowding on margins in places
*Feel free to shrink fonts when shrinking screen size to reduce some crowding
*Verify GitHub repo matches what you have on your computer
*Utilize Li's as buttons
*ensure an alt tag is on images for accessability

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects are where I beleive I learned the most and were probably the most challenging for me. Traditionally I have always worked in more of an isolated environment where I could challenge myself at my own pace, as I am usually self reliant. However group projects have forced me to collaborate in ways I never thought I would need to reach. I really feel like I have grown in this area and look forward to moving forward even further.

#### Linked-list

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cody-Price/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Create an application where the user can store bookmarks to various websites.

HTML
* Consider using aria-labels on inputs that don't have labels associated with them

CSS
* Consider using multiple classes where you have a more broad class for shared styles: ie. card-button
* consider using organizational comments and organizing within rules

JS
* Work on naming conventions where you say what kind of element you're storing
* Leverage template literals to write your markup in your js

#### Idea-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

build a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

* Nice work with the commits and commit messages
  * Continue to keep working on creating new branches for each branch name
* Good UI and UX (awesome attention to detail)
  * The sorting is really solid
  * I love the sticky nav bar.
  * Good responsive view to the app as well.  Very good spacing and sizing.
* Good work using aria-labels and keeping the html clean and using semantic tags
  * I would load the script after the body
* Make sure to add border-box to it
* Organization and alphabetizing properties of styles
  * Continue to work on controlling main elements without having to use relative positioning
  * When you have multiple classes with similar styles trying using one class and putting them on those elements
* Nice work staying away from using global variables
* Nice use of constructor function
  * I wouldn't save the html inside of constructor function and localStorage.
* Instead of saving your ideas individually into local storage, experiment storing them into one key with an array of ideas.  Makes it easier for scalability and keeping your local storage organized.
* Nice work breaking out functions into smaller functions
* Might put the qualities inside of an array instead of multiple else if statements
* Experiment using more array prototype methods over for loops.
* Functions where you are using an if/else statement to return true or false, try returning the expression

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### To-do-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cody-Price/2dobox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

build a simple application for recording and archiving our tasks based on various priority levels.

* Getting better at creating more commits (continue to break it into even more)
  * Commit messages could be a bit longer and more descriptive
  * Branches could also be more descriptive
* Good work with the comp and UI
  * Upvote, downvote, quality, and complete task get a bit squished on mobile
  * Might make the completed task text on the button a bit bigger on desktop view
* Clean html structure and good names for classes
  * Remember to add aria-labels and roles next time for accessibility
* Remember to keep text-align only on text elements
  * Remember to group elements that have similar styles and if there are multiple classes that share styles, start a new class and put it on those
* Nice work with no nested if/else statements and global variables
* Good use of constructor function
  * Try combining the two card adding functions into one
* Try using array prototype methods over for loops
* Experiment using function declarations instead of anonymous functions in event listeners
* Might use an array for qualities instead of multiple if/else statements
* Instead of storing each todo individually, try storing them under one key and all the todos in an array

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Helped anyone who asked me regardless of what I was working on, when I noticed those around me were struggling I stopped what I was doing to help them understand the concepts. Attended every group learning session. Assisted my classmates on slack when I had the ability and resources to help.
