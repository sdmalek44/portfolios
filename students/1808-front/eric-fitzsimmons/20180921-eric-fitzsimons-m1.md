# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

### I had no idea what to expect out of my time at Turing.  Mod 1 was very daunting and my only goal coming in was to become proficient in whatever was thrown at me.  I had no coding experience before starting the pre-work and made sure that I was not trying to complete projects, but rather, trying to gain knowledge and understanding.

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### I believe that I passed the assesments that I have taken.  That being said, considering that there is an amount of work that I didn't get to on past projects, and areas where my Static Comps have lacked, I'm unsure of how I would measure-up against the standards needed to pass into Mod 2.  This could come from second-guessing myself throughout the mod or from the fact that all the Mod 2 students seem so much more proficent.  Mostly, there is an amount of unknown that comes with studying here at Turing that leaves me trepidatious about advancing prematurely. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Mod 1 had 4 solo projects.  The first was interactive and the following 3 were static.

### Number Guesser

#### https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Number-Guesser
#### http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

### Number Guesser asks the fledgling coder to grab the value from an input and measure it against a randomly generated number.  It was an introduction to functional programming and how a coder deals with the ins-and-outs of JS basics.  It was hard.  I learned a lot about how much could be done with a seemingly-simple application.

### Evaluator: Nathaniel Foster
### Notes/What To Work On:
### Fix min/max range bugs Make submit range button look like other buttons Refactor CSS class with hover state

### Functional Expectations
#### Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
#### Advanced Beginner
### HTML
#### Proficient
### CSS

### JS/jQuery

### Static Comp 1

#### https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Static-Comp-1
#### http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

#### Static Comp 1 was the first foray into making a beautiful website.  I was able to make a fully responsive layout but neglected extensive use of hover states.  I also could have centered my pictures a bit more.  As Louisa might say, it could use a final pass to tighten things up.


### Static Comp 2

#### https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Static-Comp-2
#### http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

#### SC2 was a large undertaking.  I had positioning issues and redundant code in my CSS.  Learning about naming conventions and how to better organize my stylesheet was a positive takeaway.  There were a number of techniques used, some of which included the more advanced Grid functionality, which created a special challenge.

### Static Comp 3

#### http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html
#### https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Static-Comp-3

#### Wow.  This one was a beast.  Positioning challenges were only one part of SC3.  Making this one responsive has been tough.  Time management during the push to prep for the final evals certainly got the best of me.  I made sure to start early, but early was not early enough.  I learned a lot about why naming conventions really help with developer empathy and the ability to read comprehensible code.  I also learned about why it is very important to know where your media queries will kick in, hopefully well before starting. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### We had 3 paired projects.  I believe that I was good at working with my partners, helping when I could, leading when necessary, and following when I was unsure.  Working side-by-side with a partner has always been fun for me because I love interacting with other people.  I believe that my partners and I did well working together, learning how to get along while also trying to get the most out of each other.

### Linked List

### https://github.com/ericfitzsimons451/Linked-List
### http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

#### Linked List asked my partner and I to create elements in JS and allow the user to interact with the app.  Manipulatingthe DOM to induce color changes and the deletion of elements were where the focus lay.  Learning how to deal with event bubbling was a challenge.  However, this gave me an idea of how DOM manipulation works.

#### Student: Eric and Hillary
#### Evaluator: David Whitaker
#### Notes/What To Work On:

#### HTML 
#### Consider using aria-labels on inputs that don't have labels associated with them

### CSS
#### Consider using multiple classes where you have a more broad class for shared styles: ie. card-button

### JS
#### Good naming conventions.  Try to see if a string includes something in it instead of matching the whole thing, as the whole thing will likely change.

### Functional Expectations
#### Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
#### Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Idea Box

#### https://github.com/KylieStanley/idea-box
#### http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

#### Idea Box was our first use of local storage and constructor functions.  It was a daunting task.  Conceptually, I understood what was happening throughout the code-base.  However, being able to read code is different from being able to write it.  I was very good at working with my partner.  She, in turn, was very good at helping me understand the things that I was having trouble conceptualizing.  This was an first experience at Turing when I felt that my partner's level of understanding trumped mine.  However, it exposed me to some techniques that I might not have otherwise seen.  Watching someone that knows how to code well, and still understanding what is happening, can be mesmerizing.

#### Student: Kylie Stanley & Eric Fitzsimons
#### Evaluator: Travis Rollins

### Notes/What To Work On:

#### Nice work creating more commits and having descriptive messages
#### Continue to keep creating more branches and have specific names for each branch
#### Might add more spacing between buttons
#### Really good attention to detail and nice UX/UI
#### Nice work with keeping a clean html structure and using aria-labels
#### Can also add aria-label to button inside of form
#### Nice work with organization and alphabetizing css properties
#### Good work grouping some styles and using one class for multiple items
#### Be careful using vh when looking at responsiveness. Practice not only squishing it horizontally but also vertically
#### Cheers for no global variables!
#### Nice work using a constructor function for your Ideas
#### Clear names for your functions
#### For your refactor, see if you can store all of the ideas in localstorage with one key and a value of an array
#### Careful not to use nested if/else statements
#### See if you can put your qualities inside of an array and go through the qualities by index
#### For your search functionality, instead of doing display none, see if you can remove the ideas (the elements are still on the DOM even if they have display none)

### Functional Expectations
#### Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

### I am one of the first people in the class and often one of the last out the door.  There has not been a single day during Mod 1 when I didn't spend at least 8 hours at Turing.  12 hour days are fairly standard at this point.  I try and help anyone that I can, whenever I can.  As an ex-teacher, I love when I can help people understand something that they previously didn't.  I ask for help often and pair with Mod 2 students regularly.  I think that my outgoing nature helps create community within the class, something that can often go underestimated.
