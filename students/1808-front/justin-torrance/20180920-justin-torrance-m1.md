### Description:
Create an app that organizes bookmarks.

### Evaluation Comments:
Need many more small commits and branches for each feature.
Each time you are working on a bug, adding some styles, writing a new function etc.
Great work on the comp and matching the design.
Good use of semantic tags and aria labels to describe inputs and buttons.
A few places where we could replace divs with semnatic html.
Nice work CSS, a few situations where we could group some similar styles together.
Nice organization of of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations.
Remember to clear out console.logs before evals.
Instead of using alerts, try implementing the errors in the DOM.
Good work breaking functions out into smaller functions.
A few situations where you might be able to take away some of the global variables (the counters).
One or two situations where we don't need the extra else if statement, an else statement would work fine.

 ### Description:
Create an app that organizes ideas and saves them into local storage.

### Evaluation Comments:

Nice work with the commit messages
Continue to keep creating more commit messages and having smaller commits for each feature
Nice work with the comp and matching it
Make sure the delete button is also the svg from the comp
Good UX/UI and good mobile view
Might add a little more spacing between the top and title to match the spacing between the save button
Really nice with HTML structure and keeping things clean
Remember to add aria-labels to inputs and buttons inside of forms
Nice work alphabetizing the properties and structuring your css
Might consider sticking with usings ems/rems only on fonts. And only pixels/percentages for heights, widths, margins, and paddings
Nice work with organizing your javascript into global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
Nice use of event delegation for the delete button
Really like the filter array prototype method
Seems like upvote and downvote buttons got pretty complicated and snowballed into a wierd issue
So thinking how we could simplify this, I might try having the qualities inside of an array and through the the array by either incrementing or decrementing the index

### Description:
Refactor an IdeaBox codebase, then pivot to To-Do-Box.

### Evaluation Comments:


HTML:
Make sure aria-labels are not providing redundant info
Name things more based on functionality instead of location as location will change

CSS:
Love the organizational comments
Love the multiple class architecture
Think about using min-width on containers

JS:
Think about utilizing early returns more (ie. filter)
Think about where you can pass arguments when there is duplication between functions
JQuery .on() allows for event delegation

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

* I did my best to be community-oriented this mod. 
  * I stayed late and came in on weekends to help others get started on Number Guesser.
  * I posted the most valuable info I knew on our slack page throughout the mod.
  * Early in the mod, I highly encouraged pairing, which I believe led to greater success for several students.
  * I responsed as quickly as possible on slack when others reached out to me for help debugging.
  * I believe that I made a very positive impact on my cohort from my willingness to help and from my positive attitude.
