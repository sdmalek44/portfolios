# Kaylee Bunce - M1 - Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Coming into Turing, I first and foremost wanted to make it through mod 1 successfully. Successfully means several things including: soaking up and retaining as much information as possible, keeping myself physically and mentally recharged, and developing and implementing skills that will help throughout my time here at Turing and when I enter the workforce. I sought out to implement certain study habits on the weekends that helped me review the past week's lectures as well as pre-reading next week's lectures. I knew that time management and delegation was going to be important as I am know to jump around and get distracted very easily.

#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

#### Overview
  - Recreate the static comp provided with the integrity of the original design. There is no liberty with the layout, however there are liberties with the color pallette, icons, and pictures. The site must be responsive.

#### Feedback
  - Pay attention to colors and their values compared to the section next to it.
  - Utilize Empty space better when breaking the page down.
  - Add icons to the buttons in the main content section.

#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

#### Overview
  - Recreate the static comp provided with the integrity of the original design. There is no liberty with the layout, however there are liberties with the color pallette, icons, and pictures. The site must be responsive.

#### Feedback
  - Pay attention to margins. All items along the edge of the pages should be lined up accordingly
  - Add hover states to icons within the buttons instead of just the font
  - Buttons when in hover state should not move the content around it
  - In mobile view, have the logo take up more of the space

### Static Comp #3

#### GitHub Repo
  - https://github.com/kayleenovak/kb-comp-challenge-3
  
#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

#### Overview
  - Recreate the static comp provided with the integrity of the original design. There is no liberty with the layout, however there are liberties with the color pallette, icons, and pictures. The site must be responsive.

#### Feedback
  - Organize the social area at the bottom better in the smaller media queries
  - Keep the toggle options expanded longer, and keep more options visible in the modile view
  - Aria labels on buttons
  - Aria label on search should explain more than just "search"
  - Try not to use position absolute on the icons
  - Don't use text align on non-text elements
  - Don't use !important
---------------------
## C: Group Work & Projects

Projects to build collaboration skills while also learning to work efficiently and effectively in a collaboration setting. 

### Linked List

#### GitHub Repo
  - https://github.com/kayleenovak/Linked-List
#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

#### Overview
  - Build an application that takes two inputs, a website name and the website's URL, to create a bookmark which should be prepended to the page. Each bookmark should have a delete and marked as read button. The delete button should delete the associated bookmark, and the mark as read button should be marked as read when the associated button is clicked. The application should have a function that omits an incorrect URL. The application should have a "Clear Read Bookmarks" button which will change the read bookmarks back to unread bookmarks. The application should keep the integrity of the original design.

#### Evaluation Comments
  - Need many more small commits and branches for each feature
  - Great work on the comp and matching the design
  - Good use of semantic tags and aria labels to describe inputs and buttons
  - Nice work CSS, a few situations where we could group some similar styles together
  - Nice organization of of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
  - Remember to clear out console.logs before evals
  - Instead of using alerts, try implementing the errors in the DOM
  - Good work breaking functions out into smaller functions
  - A few situations where you might be able to take away some of the global variables (the counters)
  - One or two situations where we don't need the extra else if statement, an else statement would work fine

### IdeaBox

#### GitHub Repo
  - https://github.com/kayleenovak/IdeaBox
#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html
  
#### Overview
  - Build an application that takes two inputs, an idea title and an idea, and appends/prepends them to the DOM. Each idea should be an object that is accessible in localStorage. The idea should have a title, body, and a quality. The quality should have the ability to be updated throuhg upvote and downvote buttons. The new quality should be reflected in localStorage. Each idea should have a delete button that will not only delete it from the page, but also delete it from localStorage. The application should have a search bar that filters and only displays content that is being searched for. The application should keep the integrity of the original design.

#### Evaluation Comments
  - Make sure you get all the fonts pulled in!
  - Good attention to detail in the comp, refactor to have fewer media queries as the screen size breaks down

#### Evaluation Scores
  - Eval scores not posted

### 2DoBox

#### GitHub Repo
  - https://github.com/kayleenovak/2DoBox-Pivot
  
#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

#### Overview
  - Take an IdeaBox project from a past student and refactor with guidelines. These guidelines include JS functions not exceeding 8 lines of code as well as keeping all the variables local. Once refactored, the application should have editable cards that once saved should updated to localStorage. Each ToDo card should have a button called "Completed Task" that will mark the task completed as well as update the task in localStorage. Each ToDo should have a level of imporatance that can be updated via upvote and downvote buttons. The updated importances should be updated in localStorage. The page should only show the 10 most recent ToDos and have a button that will expand to show all of the ToDos if clicked. There should be 5 buttons indicated each level of importance. If one of the buttons is clicked only the ToDos matching the importance of the buttons should be displayed.

#### Evaluation Comments
  - Good naming conventions
  - Consider adding organizational comments
  - DRY it up!!!!
  - Think about where you can pass arguments when there is duplication between functions

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I soaked up all of the help that I could get. It took a while for me to come out of my shell and really to start developing friendships within the mod as well as a few people from mod 2. There were a handful of times that I was able to share my knowledge with fellow classmates that were struggling, specifically on mythical creatures. I am looking forward to continuing to build relationships within Turing so that I can play a larger part in the community in future mods. I am also very excited to help the new students in mod 1. I was so encouraged by several people from mod 2. I want to be sure to spread the same encouragement that I received.
