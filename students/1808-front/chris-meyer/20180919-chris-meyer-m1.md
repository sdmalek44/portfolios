Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

## Notes/What To Work On:
* Don't work off master branch!
  * Nice descriptive commit messages.
  * Create lots more branches and commits!
* Add more spacing between inputs
* The inputs overlap into the lower section as the screen gets smaller
* Clean html structure and good use of aria labels  
  * Make sure aria labels are spelled correctly and are in opening html tag
  * Might move the h1 out of the form part
* Make sure you refactor css styles
  * Good organization and alphabetizing properties
  * Group styles that have similar styles (like flex)
  * Some red flags with percentages on texts or display inline-block on inline block elements
* Nice work with no global variables
* Nice work keeping functions short
* Might experiment using array prototypes over for loops
* Instead of hiding each element, try removing them as you search
* Might try storing all of your 2dos inside of an array under one key in local storage instead of individually
* Good start keeping track of which quality is being stored in the constructor function under state
  * Instead of having multiple if/else statements checking if the state is a value, try having a local variable with an array of all of the qualities.  Then you can keep track of the indexValue in the constructor function.  Then when a user clicks up or down, the index bumps up or down respectively.
