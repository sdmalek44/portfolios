# Paul Vangelakos - M1 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to accomplish learning the fundamentals of hmtl, css, and javascript in a classroom format. I have previously tried to learn some of these things on my own without any luck. I also wanted to take a deep dive into conditional statements and writing functions specifically in JS.

Pass. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pvinthemix/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description:
This project incorporates basic understanding of html, css, and javascript. Number guesser is a basic web application for guessing and generating random numbers. It was our first and only individual project during this module.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pvinthemix/Linkedlist)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This is an application where you create bookmarks that would be displayed to the DOM. The focus was on DOM manipulation and being able to append, edit, and delete items that did not exist on page load. The emphasis was on event delegation, grabbing elements and adding event listeners, learning basic functions of JavaScript.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pvinthemix/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This is an application adds an extra level to our last project. It emphasized the use of local storage as well as an introduction into the JQuery library. This was a challenging project in which you had to really think about how functions worked together to create the page.

#### Two-Do-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colev1/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This application uses objects and localStorage to create a list of reminders(to-dos) for users. The application required that we re-factor a previous students work, avoid global variables, and keep functions to under 8 lines if possible. This was a very good learning experience and introduction into clean functional programming.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I played a role in the Turing community by pairing and meeting tons of people from not only the upper front-end modules but also the back-end program. Outside of introducing myself, I was able to pair on at least 20 occasions with other students. These pairings played a part in my learning development as well as playing a part in the community. I have really enjoyed getting to lots of people from different backgrounds and experiences which create the Turing community. Turing strives to be an inclusive program and I hope to continue to foster this during each module.
