# Jamie Rushford - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to build a strong base of knowledge and skills to support me as I move beyond Mod 1 into more complex topics. I knew coming into the program that logic and JavaScript would be something I would have to work a little harder at than design/CSS work, so I tried to spend a good amount of time focusing on dialing those skills. I also looked to start finding my own professional place in software development/the things I gravitate towards, as well as my place in the Turing community, which I look to continue doing, and perhaps doing more so, throughout my time here. In terms of technical skills going forward I want to continue practicing JS and logic so that I feel more comfortable with it as things start to get more complex. I also want to just continue playing with CSS and design to keep up those skills and continue to polish and expand what I feel comfortable doing on that side of things.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project involved making a game where a user gusses a number between 1 and 100 and is given feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The range can also be change to increase or decrease difficulty.

##### Eval Feedback

- Like the bouncing animation for winning!
- Be sure to add directions for the user about the range changing - the numbers positined on the side are not intuitive
- Nice job using forms around inputs
- Good organization in CSS - look into [clustering related properties](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for a different approach to organization
- Watch formatting in your JS files - follow the style guide [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
- Work on naming in JS 
- Nice job with breaking functionality apart

##### Eval Scores

- Functional Expectations: Exceptional
- Comp Recreation/Design: Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- HTML: Proficient
- CSS: Proficient
- JS/jQuery: Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- Surprise and Delight: Sparkles

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/jr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project involved recreating a static site based on a provided comp. Creative liberty was given with the copy, images, and icons, provided they made sense. Creative liberty was not given with the layout, which must be also be responsive.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/jr-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project involved recreating a static site based on a provided comp. Creative liberty was given with the copy, images, and icons, provided they made sense. Creative liberty was not given with the layout, which must be also be responsive. Additionally, a CSS Normalize file must be used and the site must be compatible with Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/jr-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This project involved recreating a static site based on a provided comp. Creative liberty was given with the copy, images, and icons, provided they made sense. Creative liberty was not given with the layout, which must be also be responsive. Additionally, a CSS Normalize file must be used, the site must be compatible with Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari, and the circle graphs must be made using SVGs.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chris023/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project involved creating a small application where a user can input a title and a URL and it will dynamically create a bookmark card on the page. The cards can then marked as read or deleted.

##### Eval Feedback

COMP
* like the design decision to have the counters at the top of the bookmark section

HTML
* Consider using aria-labels on inputs that don't have labels associated with them
* Think about what pluralization in naming means

CSS
* Love the organizational comments
* Love the multiple class structure

JS
* Good naming conventions
* pull duplicate chunks of code into their own functions and pass arguments where necessary

- Git/GitHub: Advanced Beginner/Proficient

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was similar to Linked List in that it took user inputs and displayed them on the page. This project also added the use of localStorage and being able to persist changes, as well as the ability to filter results based on a search input.

##### Eval Feedback

* Nice work with the commits and commit messages
  * Continue to keep working on creating new branches for each branch name
* Good UI and UX (awesome attention to detail)
  * The sorting is really solid
  * I love the sticky nav bar.
  * Good responsive view to the app as well.  Very good spacing and sizing.
* Good work using aria-labels and keeping the html clean and using semantic tags
  * I would load the script after the body
* Make sure to add border-box to it
* Organization and alphabetizing properties of styles
  * Continue to work on controlling main elements without having to use relative positioning
  * When you have multiple classes with similar styles trying using one class and putting them on those elements
* Nice work staying away from using global variables
* Nice use of constructor function
  * I wouldn't save the html inside of constructor function and localStorage.
* Instead of saving your ideas individually into local storage, experiment storing them into one key with an array of ideas.  Makes it easier for scalability and keeping your local storage organized.
* Nice work breaking out functions into smaller functions
* Might put the qualities inside of an array instead of multiple else if statements
* Experiment using more array prototype methods over for loops.
* Functions where you are using an if/else statement to return true or false, try returning the expression

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/2dobox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project was very similar to IdeaBox, but it required refactoring a previously created version of IdeaBox that needed some work and debugging, and then shifting the functionality to work as a todo list. Additional functionality included being able to sort by importance using buttons and limiting the display to 10 cards and having a button to show more/less.

##### Eval Feedback

- really nice looking UI
- nice animations
- clean, tight CSS
- really well executed CSS
- super tight, clean JS
- very thoughtful, well factored and smart execution of JS
- GREAT JOB!!!!!

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I am definitely a pretty introverted person, so at times it can be difficult for me to integrate into new communities with lots of new people. That said I really like the Turing community and have made an effort to put myself out there a bit in it, which I want to continue to push myself to do over the coming months. I have gone to and really enjoyed some events like the Demo Comp night at WeWork earlier this block. And I feel like on a smaller scale within our class I have made an attempt to reach out or offer help when I can to people around me who are looking for it. Moving forward I would like to continue building this support within our cohort (and the greater community), giving help where I can and receiving it where needed. I would also like to start getting more involved now in some more events/groups outside of just normal classes now that I feel a little more settled in the community.
