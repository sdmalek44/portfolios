# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to learn more about Ruby and Programming as a whole. To learn about best practices,
TDD, OOP, and Ruby syntax specifically. I would say I was successful. I have learned a lot
about mocking, stubbing, best practices (Encapsulation), and OOP and even the _weeds_ of Ruby
itself. I have learned how to work with gems, packages, and frameworks. I have learned to become more
comfortable reading documentation. I am far more comfortable reading but also copying an example and
immediately working with it.

I also set out to learn more about working with others and Git and Github. I have worked with others on
two projects now and have some experience working on a large (for me) project with others. Black thursday
involved many branches and merging Git workflows. I am very grateful for the opportunity and would say I have been successful at learning how to work with others better. How to communicate my own needs and to listen to the input and needs of others.

### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most when it came to learning to code more efficiently and quickly. I have also struggled with the tendency to overcomplicate problems. Also to try and refactor code all at once rather than having something to work with first then refactoring.

What I have learned from all my struggles can ultimately be summarized with - code is cheap. I have found that 9 times out of 10 it is better to start writing code or even to start writing out pseudocode. Attempting to refactor it into a perfect state the first time can be overwhelming.
I have also found that it is best to really read the spec and take each iteration step-by-step. I tend to get the gist of it and start implementing some general structure for future iterations before starting to breakdown the current iteration. I find it's better to start writing out the problem immediately and implementing a solution for _only_ what is asked for.


## Projects

### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was actually Battleship. Many feel that was a nightmare project but I actually found that to be a nice first project, Tony and I had some fun with it. It was fun to work with someone else on a project that was so open ended. There was a lot of creativity involved and the lack of structure was both liberating and frustrating. It was a new experience for me to collaborate with another developer on potential solutions, best practices, and testing.

My least favorite project was black thursday. I learned the most during this project so in that regard - it was the best project but considering how vague the specifications were. It was frustrating but the frustrations were not the kind were it was a rewarding challenge - it was more frustrating because we were not sure as to how to even go about writing the code or the test because nobody knew what was even being asked for. Working with BigDecimal also sucked.

### What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned how to work at the same level of standards that I am accustomed to but to do so at a much faster rate. I learned about Ruby and how to work with Git (branches and commits).

### What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned how to better work with others and collaborate effectively - to be clear on what I don't understand. Working on Battleship and Black thursday - I got more experience communicating exactly what I know and I where my lack of understanding lies.

## Community

### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Honestly I would say I did not contribute in any way besides forming relationships with my cohort mates and that article that Tony and I wrote.


### What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to post more technical articles on Medium and tag Turing School. Technical articles demonstrate knowledge but also help put your name out there. It would also help promote Turing. I do plan on writing a review article when I graduate or leave because I got a job early. _Wait did he just suggest that he's going to get a job before graduating?_ Yes, yes I did.
