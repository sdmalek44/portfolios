## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I wanted to learn the basics of test-driven development and object-oriented programming.  I think I have a good grasp on the basics and with more practice, I’ll become even more confident.  I’m a brand-new Mac user, so I also wanted to feel more comfortable using ‘hot keys’ and the Mac interface in general.  Seeing ‘hot keys’ as a question on the CFUs helped me understand that it was also a learning goal of Turing, and I think I’m getting better there as well.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled the most with concepts we were expected to teach ourselves (mostly during projects).  I learn best after I see someone else complete a certain task, and I doubt my abilities to teach myself.  I did learn to ask for help, and found that setting a timer helps avoid falling down rabbit holes and teaching myself the wrong concepts.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite projects were Battleship and Enigma, and my least favorite was Black Thursday.  I liked Battleship, because, in the way my partner and I broke it up at least, I was able to put into practice what I’d learned so far, and I was excited to do that.  Enigma was challenging, but interesting.  Black Thursday was my least favorite because it was so tedious and felt a bit repetitive by the end of it.  We were stuck on one portion of the end of the project that none of us knew how to do, and this was reflected in our score, which was a bit demoralizing, especially given the amount of time and effort we’d put into working on it.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned how to operate Command Line Interface, and I learned better ways for mapping out my thoughts before beginning to code.
I also better solidified the difference between private and public methods.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
 I learned to pay attention to how other people communicate best / their preferred styles of communication.  I also learned to set clear expectations for time management.  The ‘forced’ retros we had in our group projects were also helpful in clearing the floor for communication and expectations.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
 I tried to get to know each of my cohort-mates and take the time to speak to them one-on-one.  I’m a big fan of walk-and-talks.  I did my best to be respectful of others’ beliefs and create a safe space to share when desired.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
 I’d like to have the opportunity to get to know everyone better.  I may not be the one people go to for homework help, but I hope my cohort-mates recognize that I could be an ear to listen if that’s the type of support that’s needed.
