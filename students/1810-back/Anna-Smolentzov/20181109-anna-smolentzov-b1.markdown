# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- I wanted to get a solid basis in programming in Ruby, which was expanded in the first week or so to get comfortable with TDD and OOP in general. I do feel like I was successful - I feel vastly more comfortable with programming than I did before starting this module, and also feel comfortable with TDD and OOP in general. In addition, I wanted to start to get a feel for what the 'tech industry' is like, and what that might mean for future possible jobs and the job search. In that respect, I thought the Agile PD session was especially helpful. Attending various talks (e.g. Friday talks) has also helped, and I do think I have started to get a feel for the field. 

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- Shifting from thinking about programming as a linear process (first do A, then do B) to thinking about programming from an OOP perspective - objects sending messages to each other. This is something I am still struggling with, but Enigma was a good exercise in needing to design something in an OOP fashion from scratch, which was helpful. It was also a good reminder that while I can read about concepts/watch videos/consider examples, I need to actually work through things to really learn them. The Ruby exercises were fantastically helpful for that! Unfortunately it's harder to have similar exercises for designing a class/method structure for a program. 

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- Favorites: Battleship, Enigma
- Least Favorite: Sorting Cards, Black Thursday
- Battleship gets on my favorite list in large part because it was a lot of fun to be paired with Anten - I learned a lot really quickly about things like polymorphism/duck typing and class methods and variables. It was fun to be challenged. Enigma was fun because (for better or worse), it was all up to me, and I feel like I put together a fairly clean final project, which was really satisfying. 
- I honestly can't say that I "didn't like" any of the projects - I enjoyed all of them. What earned Sorting Cards a spot on the "least favorite" list is that it was frustrating to look at code that works, but have this vague feeling that there would be ways to make it better... but not know where to start in making it "better". For Black Thursday, I would have liked to turn in a cleaner final product, but we ran out of time, so that puts it on the "least favorite" list for me. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- Designing classes/methods is hard - harder than the logic.
- Front-loading the work helps me feel much more on top of things. 
- Having some sort of project management (waffle, bullet journal list) tool still helps so that I don't lose track of ideas or things I need to revisit. 
- Remember to talk to other people! Help people out and ask questions.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
- Dividing work up is hard. 
- Bouncing ideas around can be lots of fun. 
- If both people/the whole group are clearly low on energy - time for a pom/snack/nap. Somehow the effects are magnified with the number of people, and time spent coding doesn't end up helpful.
- Be mindful of the "space" I'm taking up - make sure everyone is heard when it comes to design ideas and/or code specifics. 
- Task/project management is key - some sort of shared tool (Trello, waffle) was super helpful to make sure everyone was on the same page and we could keep track of ideas and things to refactor/revisit. 

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- Participated in the Joan Clarke Society most weeks, made it out running with the Runtime posse all of once. Generally trying to be a good cohort member in terms of helping out when I can!

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- Get out running with the Runtime posse more, and continue to go to JCS - they've both already proven a great way to meet people not in my cohort! Check out some of the other posses (whiteboarding in particular).
