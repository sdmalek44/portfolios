## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Having some programming experience when I started the program, I mainly wanted to learn OOP, testing, and filling in the gaps of my current understanding of CS during mod1. I also wanted to be more proficient in a language compared to any I've learned in the past. I believe I was successful. I now feel comfortable using OOP and testing. I also was able to do some side projects, such as Complete Me, to learn about data structures. I also hated using hashes before the program since I didn't really know them, but now they're one of my favorite things to use. Finally, Ruby is a lot of fun to program in and I feel pretty comfortable doing most things required so far, or at least comfortable knowing where to find how quickly.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

Originally learning OOP and how to call objects from other objects, as well as how to figure out which classes to make was my biggest struggle. Through the struggle I learned the basics of OOP! I also learned to practice, and keep practicing, and then practice until it clicks. And then keep practicing.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was probably Complete Me or Enigma, and a little bit Battleship. The puzzles required were a lot of fun to solve, and my Enigma crack solution was able to take an original brute force solution and make it into an efficient solution, so it was fun to refactor that one. My least favorite was Black Thursday due to the structure of the project. Having a solution and then building something to meet the solution regardless of if it answers the original question didn't seem like a great learning method.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

The independent projects were fun to do. I was able to get a lot of practice in each week, as well as learn new ways to do things by looking through other people's submissions after everyone turned theirs in.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

The paired projects were interesting because I've never paired with programming before. I was able to learn how to split up things and plan things so that different parts of a program will come together even though other people have worked on it. It was also good practice with github.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I was an active participant in the 3D printing slack channel giving out help and suggestions to people when they needed it. I also designed and printed the coffee container locator to locate the coffee while it was brewing. It worked well until they replaced the coffee machine. I've also printed out many ducks for the classroom. I also participated in out of school things, such as the demo night and Brothers to get to know people better. I also tried to actively help others when possible.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I'd like to continue to get to know everyone better, as well as branch out more in to other mods, and continue to give help to others. I'll also stay active in the 3D printer slack channel, and continue printing random things for the school.
