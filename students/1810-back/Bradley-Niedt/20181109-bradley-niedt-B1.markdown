## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  This module, I set out to get proficient in ruby (being able to solve complex problems), to get better at problem-solving, and to jump head-first into the community. I was successful in becoming proficient with ruby, because I am able to solve complex problems like encryption and data analytics with ruby, and I have fun doing it. Regarding problem-solving itself - I have become better at breaking a large problem into smaller, more concise steps to solve the problem, and I look at problems from multiple angles to find better solutions. Finally, I feel like I'm very much at home here. The sense of community is amazing, and I love giving and getting help, getting closer with my cohort and with the rest of the school. The community is amazing.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  The things I struggled with most were my health and learning how to ask for help more often. With my health, I learned first-hand how tough it is to be sick and still need to put in a solid 10+ hour day and try to stay sharp. I am pretty upset that my sickness hindered by ability to work as hard as I would have liked to on the tail-end of the group project. I learned that I need to stay on top of my health, because I can't learn well or code well if I'm not healthy. Regarding asking for help - there were times that I wasted too much time trying to fix an issue, that I either forgot to ask for help earlier on, or I was too nervous to ask for help. I learned that everyone here is ridiculously nice and helpful, and that while struggling a bit is good - you need to learn when to pull in a cohort-mate or someone above you to help you see the problem from another perspective.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  Favorites - Battleship, Black Thursday, ENIGMA!!! I had a ton of fun making enigma and talking about the math and problem solving that was involved with it. I loved learning more about encryption and learning to make math fun through encryption. On Battleship - it was really cool to be able to take what we learned and build something that we could have fun with.

  My least favorite was Sorting Cards - It was fun to problem-solve, but I think that since it was so early on in the mod, I didn't approach the problem in the way I would have now, and so I made it a lot harder on myself. Also, while I actually really liked Black Thursday, I am frustrated that my health affected my performance so much when I had strep throat. If I could have put in some more time, maybe we could have done more.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned that I have a ton or fun programming, and that I need to take poms more often - sometimes I can get on a roll and not take a break for a solid hour or two. I've learned to share more with my cohort during independent projects - its fun to swap ideas on how to solve problems and see problems from different perspectives.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned that problem solving with another person is a really fun experience, but that it can be stressful too (making sure you're pulling your weight and scheduling your academic life with another person is a lot). I also learned that my cohort mates are awesome and that we really pull together when we have a problem to solve - its really cool to see and be a part of. Oh, and COMMUNICATION IS KEY. Everything is better when you communicate with your teammates a ton.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  This mod, I really wanted to dive head-first into the community and to really put my self out there to learn and grow. I am usually pretty shy/anxious, so I became an student advisory board rep for our cohort - it was amazing to be a part of that and to learn more about my cohort and to contribute to bettering the school/community. Additionally, I made it a personal goa to try to get as close to my cohort as possible and to be there for them since this school is tough mentally/physically/emotionally. I just really feel like Turing is home.
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  I would like to become more of a leader, to work hard to learn as much as I can about web apps, and use that knowledge to help my cohort-mates. I would also like to think of more ways that we can give back to the community - like the funds drive for the food bank of the rockies. Additionally, I'd like to stay in SAB if possible to keep myself engrained in the community.
