# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

- I wanted to show myself I could still learn and I could belong in the tech industry. I wanted to be able to learn the intricacies of a new language and learn how to solve problems by braking them into smaller logical components. While I still have so much to learn in Ruby and in how to approach logical problem I am really proud of how far I have come and how much I have enjoyed coding, especially the Enigma project.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

- I feel like my biggest struggle was finding a balance between self-care and focus. Balancing my personal life and the need to do exercises and project work was a struggle for me especially around mid mod. In the middle of the Battleship project I hit a place where I completely burned out and I felt like I lost a lot of motivation. From that struggle and from being able to push out of it I have learned that I need to make room for me to remember I am a human and that my brain does need to context switch from coding on a regular basis. Since that episode I have been more intentional with my time and that has helped me get where I am today.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

- My favorite project was definitely Enigma, I loved that I understood the process of encryption and that I was able to translate it into code in a way that made me happy and that felt elegant to me. I loved being able to pair with people from a more confident place and feel less lost.

- My least favorite project was Battleship, I felt very overwhelmed by how open ended it was and it felt like the tools I had at my disposal did not quite work for what I was trying to do. Needing to also pair added a stressful element to it. My biggest struggle was around class interactions and how to set the project up. If I could take a crack at it now I feel like I would find it a lot less overwhelmed. Even with it being so challenging I really believe it was an awesome lesson in grit and how to making code work.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

- From my independent project I have learn that I need to work on being more self reliant, that code is cheap and thinking logically is extremely valuable. I have also learned that I am my strongest when I can help other people and when I can rubber duck with a human being. What I would like to improve is my googling skills.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

- The extreme importance of a DTR and of being well aware of my strengths and weaknesses and being able to communicate my needs and when I need help. I also became more aware of the importance of version control and descriptive commits and pull requests.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

- I did not have as many opportunities as I would have wanted to be part of the Turing community at large this mod, I did put a lot of work in creating and fostering connections in my cohort and raise awareness around non binary identities, but I hope to be able to do more in the next mod.


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

- I would love to contribute more to the queerquoders group in the school, I would love to be able to attend more wrap ups and do some work on the 3d printing posse.
I would love to be helpful to the people in the next modules especially parents that enter the program or people under the LGBTQ+ community.
