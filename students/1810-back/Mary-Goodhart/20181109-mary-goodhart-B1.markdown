# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to be able to understand and implement whatever I was taught no matter what it was. I also wanted to make sure I was completely open to all the 'social immersion' that comes alone with going to Turing; ie GearUp, PD, cohort family, mentors, community, etc. I think I was successful with all the social immersion- not saying that it was all easy (group dynamics etc), but I definitely learned a lot and am in a different place than I started, which is a place I think I can continue moving forward and growing and learning.
As far as all the technical things (ie Ruby and class and TDD and OOP etc), I know that I understand SO MUCH MORE than I did before I got here. I still think that I have a long way to go, and tons more to learn, but that just seems normal and not the worst place to be because even Alums that I've talked to say that that is just part of it. I feel pretty capable of doing most things asked of me at this point; but that's not to say it would be easy or slightly intimidating. I imagine I would be using RubyDocs and Google and Mod2 and mentors and asking everyone questions still; but I don't have one specific topic or idea that specifically sticks out as being something I still struggle with on a really deep level. So I consider that a success.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I definitely struggled most with the group dynamic during Black Thursday. I learned that first, a really really clear DTR is essential. I still wonder if we had gotten the chance to re-DTR, how we could've moved forward. There were a couple times I didn't really know what to say during all of that, but I met with Allison afterwards and talked with her and feel more prepared moving forward to address these kinds of situations in a more knowledgeable way.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Favorite: Enigma
I enjoyed this one a lot because I thought it was fun and interesting overall. While it was actually terrifying to start, once I wrapped my head around what exactly it was, and what I needed to accomplish, I realized I had the tools to slowly be able to build it, starting with the tiniest piece. That was really exciting. I didn't get stuck on every single step which was nice to experience. I felt like I had a decent rhythm for figuring out problems and testing and taking breaks and asking for help. It was still hard and intense, but it was enjoyable as well.

Least Favorite: Black Thursday
This one was just all around difficult for me. The group dynamics to begin with just set a really weird tone for the project. It was just all really stressful. I was also sick during this time and that didn't help. I will say that I really learned how to break something into tiny steps in order to slowly build something; because that's what I had to do with standard deviation; another note is that I probably won't ever forget how to do standard deviation again.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned a lot of cool methods from the first one. I also learned how helpful it is to pair with people and ask a lot of questions, and also answer a lot of questions because once you can explain something, it really solidifies your understanding.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I learned that working together so closely with a person is a great opportunity to learn what they know and share what you know. Clear communication is essential and so is workflow. Like I said above, having a solid DTR is a great way to have something to reference back to if any problems arise. I also learned how interesting and eye opening it can be to see how differently each individual thinks and approaches a problem in coding, and a lot can be learned from being open to seeing things from other's perspectives. I think I still have a lot of growing to do in this area as far as group project completion and success.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I just tried to be open to everything that was happening in the community and immersing myself in the social aspect of this place. I tried to help out my cohort when I was able to, and be available if and when people needed to talk, or pair, or whatever. I worked at being open during our sessions with Sarah and GearUps and PD because I think that was a huge part of bringing more cohesiveness to 1810BE. I care a lot about that because I think having a cohort that is close and relies on and trusts each other directly impacts our success in this program. I also think it contributes to the overall morale a cohort will have when things get really stressful. And also I love everyone and I love having a Turing family and want us all to be successful here, so that is how I try act. I also talked at one of the Success at Turing weekends and am part of the Joan Clarke Society. Whenever it was possible, I attended wrap-up and the early morning speakers on Fridays.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to be in SAB. I would also like to be involved with TryTuring weekends and continue to chat whenever I can at Success at Turing. I know that sometimes Turing in involved with showing younger kids coding, and I am hugely interested in that. In addition to continuing moving forward and growing in what I wrote above.
