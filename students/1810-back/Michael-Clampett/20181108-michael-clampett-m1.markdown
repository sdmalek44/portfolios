# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
_In Module 1 my goal was twofold: 1) I wanted to pass the module and 2) I wanted to be 100% sure that coding was something I could do as a career._
_I feel that I was successful in meeting both of these goals; I feel that I performed well on the pentathlon, and I now feel very confident_
_that I would succeed and thrive in a coding career. I love going home and getting on my computer and programming for hours...it's almost addictive._

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
_I struggled most with being patient when working with other people. I was paired a couple times on projects where a partner was very far behind_
_and therefore I had to do most of the work due to the time constraint factor. There were times where those people were very frustrating to work with,_
_because their own motivation was very low and they wanted to either sleep or work on unrelated tasks (like 3d printing). I learned a ton from_
_those situations. I had to stand up for myself and be direct about the issues with my partners. When they would interrupt or be distracted,_
_I had to set boundaries about my expectations. When they were sluggish and not contributing, I had to work extra hard to make up for their_
_lack of contribution. The powerful thing was, I really liked those people and we got through those issues together via compassion and patience._
_These challenges gave me an opportunity to practice empathy and try to understand why those people were acting the way they were. This allowed_
_us to stay friends despite what I would consider significantly underperforming on the projects that we turned in. Nevertheless, I was able to_
_maintain rapport with them, and I think in future projects I will be more assertive about these types of things. However, I also got some exposure_
_to specific red flags to watch out for in the workplace, when put in collaborative situations. I have better tools now to deal with those flags._

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
_My favorite project was Enigma because the volume of work to time allotted ratio was actually manageable._
_My least favorite project was battleship because it was too much to tackle given my skillset at the time, and my partner didn't really contribute much._

What did you learn from your independent projects?
_I got tons of practice with enumerables, shorthand, ternary operator, and helper method refactoring. In the context of coding, I think it was much more_ _educational than the other types of projects._

What did you learn from your paired projects?
_I got some exposure to inject and reduce, and lots of class interaction practice. I also got to work on my soft skills, like empathy,_
_agile, and other project management tools._

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
_I made myself available as a person people could go to if they needed to talk about things or work on code together._

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
_I would like to be cleaner. Sometimes I leave trash and tea mugs around! Also, more importantly, continue to be a neutral person_
_that people can come to for emotional or technical help._
