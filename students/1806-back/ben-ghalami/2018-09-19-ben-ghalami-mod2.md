## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

This mod I wanted to get better at working in a team. I've always struggled feeling comfortable with others working on projects I'm attached to. If something is less than amazing I don't feel comfortable showing it off. This mod I've learned to not only work on a team and lead a team, but I was able to trust my team and not question the work they've done. It was pretty cool to witness this transition first hand, going from being a lone wolf, to a member of a pack.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The biggest thing I struggled with was self doubt. There would be times where I would think I wouldn't get it. Where something didn't make sense, and that's a relatively foreign feeling for me. I felt like maybe mod 1 was a fluke and I didn't actually belong here. As time went on things became more solidified and I ended up being more confident in the end. The biggest thing I've learned from this was just because something doesn't make sense right away, doesn't mean it will never make sense. It's like being a lone wolf, thinking he'll never find a pack. When he finally does, he wonders why he even worried in the first place.

Yes.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

Rails Mini, I liked implementing what I wanted. Also, I really like working alone. I finished it 3 days early it was nice to just have a little bit of rest. 
Little Shop, it was a difficult transition learning web frameworks. Going from feeling like you know it all to very quickly feeling like you know nothing is like leaving your wolf pack thinking being a lone wolf is the way to be, but in the end it's not. 

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I didn't really learn anything to far outside of what we were taught in class. But it did reinforce the fact that this wolf works best alone. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned how to trust team members. I learned to have more faith in people. I learned that sometimes a wolf needs to trust his pack, even when he can't see all the pieces. 

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I did my best helping my pack. When I see another student struggling or trying to work through something, I won't hesitate to jump on the opportunity to help out. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I would like to offer more help to lower mods. I set out to do that this mod but realized I didn't quite have the time. So I hope to make time for the Turing pack next mod.
