# (Dylan Meskis) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  I wanted to learn how to utilize a web framework to build a working application.
  It was very important to me to understand how the whole process works, from
  a browser request, to the response returning a web page. It was also important
  to me to learn how to use a database and query it effectively. I feel I have
  learned quite a lot, from barely knowing what SQL and even what a web framework
  was, to being able to use these tools proficiently.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The only individual project we had this mod was the Rails Mini project. An
independent, un-assessed designed to test our knowledge of Rails.

#### (Rails Mini - FormHelper)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dmeskis/rails_mini)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

The inspiration for this project came from my sister, who is a special education
teacher at Infinity middle school in Aurora, CO. She has her students fill out
forms every day reflecting on how their day went, and she mentioned to me how
inefficient her current way of doing it through google docs was. I set out to
design a web app where students can submit forms through a friendly UI, parents
can view their students forms, and teachers can manage these forms.

This project was not formally evaluated, but I did give a demo of it in front
of my classmates.

#### (Blog Post)

* [Blog Url](https://medium.com/@dylanmeskis/setting-up-your-first-rails-project-809fecd4d167)

As part of our professional development we were tasked with writing a technical
blog post. This is my first ever blog post, so I wrote a simple tutorial to help
new developers set up their first rails project.

#### (ActiveRecord Obstacle Course)
* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/dmeskis/activerecord-obstacle-course)
* [Pull Request Url](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/activerecord-obstacle-course/pull/1)
Promotion to mod 3 requires completion of a ActiveRecord obstacle course, which
features many queries in Ruby that needed to be translated into ActiveRecord.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During module two, we had three group projects. The first was Little Shop,
which was an introduction to Sinatra and using databases. It was essentially a
rehash of our final from last mod, Black Thursday, where we built out an ORM in
Ruby. This time around we had the convenience of using ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL
to perform these queries, with an emphasis on the web framework side. The second
project was Job Tracker. The idea of this project was that a developer was
seeking work, and created a website to track job opportunities. The final group
project was Bike Share. This is a large scale project with many user stories
where we created a bike shop selling many items where a user can order goods,
as well as an analytical side where we crunched data from a San Francisco
bike share program.

#### (Little Shop)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dmeskis/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

For Little Shop I worked with Ben Ghalami (https://github.com/bghalami)
and Daniel Mulitauopele (https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele). This was the
first project that any of us had worked on with more than two contributors.
This meant we had to fully utilize project management tools and make sure our
git workflow was on point. We decided to use Waffle.io to create our user stories,
and elected Daniel as the project manager. We also made to sure to divide up the
so we could all work on front and back-end programming.

## Evaluation Process

1. Feature Completeness

* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

2. Views

* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)

3. Controller

* Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring

4. Models

* Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

5. ActiveRecord

* Below Expectations: Ruby is used to programmatically solve problems where ActiveRecord could be used

6. Testing

* Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels

7. Usability

* Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready

8. Workflow

* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### (Job Tracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KathleenYruegas/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was the second group project of the module. I worked with Kathleen
Yruegas (https://github.com/KathleenYruegas) on this project. Again, we made
sure to make good use of Waffle.io, and this time around I felt much more
comfortable with that process. I felt a good synergy with Kat. We would meet up,
define our goals for the day, and then get to work. We tended to work more
independently in the past, but we were available to each other if either of us
had any questions.

#### (Bike Share)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mmbensalah/bike_share)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/bike-share-redux)

Bike Share was our final and most intensive project. I worked again with
Kathleen Yruegas (https://github.com/KathleenYruegas), and also with Miriam
Bensalah (https://github.com/mmbensalah). Our team was at a disadvantage for
this project, as most groups had an fourth team member. We were aware of this,
and preloaded as much work as possible accordingly. This project tested everything
we learned this module, Rails routing, namespacing, authentication, authorization,
intermediate ActiveRecord queries, sessions, cookies, etc.

### 9. Documentation

* Meets Expectations: A custom README is present and gives users an guide to the what and how your application


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

The Turing community was great this module. While I was definitely absorbed in
my own learning, I still made it a point to show up to code fairs and other
extracurriculars whenever possible. It's always a fun time relaxing and
exploring other students creations. I supported the community this module by
trying to help out the mod 1 back end students as much as possible. I gave a
lightning talk on tips that I thought would help them with their final project,
and talked a few students through problems they were running into.

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  I wanted to learn how to utilize a web framework to build a working application.
  It was very important to me to understand how the whole process works, from
  a browser request, to the response returning a web page. It was also important
  to me to learn how to use a database and query it effectively. I feel I have
  learned quite a lot, from barely knowing what SQL and even what a web framework
  was, to being able to use these tools proficiently.


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  ActiveRecord and SQL was a struggle for me. It just did not click for me immediately,
  and I had trouble visualizing how these tables were being joined together.
  Repetition is what eventually got it to click, as well as additional help
  from my instructors. I learned that perseverance is key to learning.

Summary (1-3 sentences):

  As part of our professional development we were tasked with writing a technical
  blog post. This is my first ever blog post, so I wrote a simple tutorial to help
  new developers set up their first rails project.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord? Yes


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  BikeShare and Rails Mini were my favorite projects. Bike Share was cool because
  it essentially allowed us to put together all the pieces we learned this module
  into a large scale working app. Rails Mini was exciting because for the first
  time at Turing we got to create something from scratch with no guidelines.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

  How to take an app idea and design the architecture for an app based on it.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

  How to collaborate effectively as a team and utilize project management tools.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  The Turing community was great this module. While I was definitely absorbed in
  my own learning, I still made it a point to show up to code fairs and other
  extracurriculars whenever possible. It's always a fun time relaxing and
  exploring other students creations. I supported the community this module by
  trying to help out the mod 1 back end students as much as possible. I gave a
  lightning talk on tips that I thought would help them with their final project,
  and talked a few students through problems they were running into.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to make myself even more available to lower mod students and
  join a posse.

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?

How has your posse expereince helped you grow as a professional?
