## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

This module I set out to learn Rails, RSpec, ActiveRecord, CSS, HTML, HTTP request/response cycle, SQL, Routing, and Database setup. I feel that I was successful in learning. I put in long days every single day of the mod. I loved seeing what our new skills could produce. The volume of content was overwhelming, my goal was to put in the time and to be better than yesterday. Working hard to set up great data content that would be rendered on a webpage was a thrill. There were several moments where I would look at a teammate after we spun up on rails s or heroku and say "look at what we just made". It is quite a different feeling from seeing output in the terminal. I enjoyed learning ActiveRecord. I have always enjoyed data analytics. Numbers tell a story, and we need to know how to dig for that information. The projects, especially BikeShare showed me how to find great data that has so many implications for business, community, social observation etc. 


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
Volume of work, I consistently put in 10-12 hours each day, including a few 14 hour days. There was so much new content to keep track of. At times it felt as though I was juggling different concepts in the air. Throughout the mod the puzzle pieces would come together. I enjoyed seeing my progress throughout the mod. Learning a new skill that I was intimidated by at first, then applying it with reference, and then applying it by second nature. Through the struggle I would ask questions, reach out to my fellow members of my cohort. I paired with my mentor twice a week. I reached out and paired with my instructors as well. Learning through the struggle built skills that I will continue to use. How to believe in myself, how to break a problem down, how to build a great test to start TDD, and where to look for guidance on a question.

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?

Yes, it was extremely helpful. Always wanted to know exactly how great data is produced. This has started my journey. I was able to get many of the tests to pass on my own. Then there were challenging tests that I needed further guidance after looking at resources.  I would pair with my mentor and she help to guide me. I remember one particular evening where I slacked her a question. She took me down the path of how to pass that particular test. After that one test was passing I was able to get a good chunk of tests after that on my own. It was a great feeling.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I really enjoyed Bike Share. I felt like it helped to bring all of the puzzle pieces together. Its size demands that everyone learn parts of the entire project. Tons of CRUD, testing, and routes. Brought everything we learned together in a large project. I actually ride a Denver Bcyle(a similar Bikeshare program here in Denver) to school everyday. I have often wondered who rides the bikes, how often they get used, the hottest locations, events, etc. The dashboard analytics were fun to look over. I used to live in the bay area, and I kept thinking about what Denver's stats would like. Fun project to see first hand how great data is produced.
  LittleShop was my least favorite. I think it was due to getting the project done while being exposed to a bunch of brand new material for the first time.  Learning Sinatra, styling, routes, a new testing program. Despite being the project I liked the best. It was helpful in learning how to produce a website and begin to understand all the different parts needed.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned to work through challenges independently as well as reach out for ideas on occasion. Main challenge was implementing admin authorization on first exposure. Utulized several resources, but was not able to get functioning by deadline. I enjoyed the styling aspects of the project. I also really enjoyed the concept of the project. I often have ideas, or thoughts on how to plan or improve an idea. On several occasions I wished I had an app where I could add notes to an idea. Add things to look into, problems to look out for, resources available, etc.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  Workflow, more familiar with github. Very much enjoyed working with all of my project partners. Especially enjoyed Waffle. The waffle cards really helped to keep everyone dialed in with where the project was at. At any given moment, we could look at waffle to see what was going on. What has been completed? Who is working on what right now? What needs to be done next? Waffle is an excellent workflow management tool.


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?


Checked into mod 1 classroom several times through the inning to check on the repeaters, meet new students, and answer questions.

Checked into mod 3 classroom several times through the inning to see how everyone was doing and ask questions/advice.

Reached out to fellow cohort members to help us all manage stress levels.

Hosted an evening backyard campfire smores social. Had several students from BE mods 1 and 2 gather.

Helped organize an ActiveRecord work session for the mod.


What would you like to do to contribute next module?

Continue to support our community as best I can. The community here is vital to student success. The stress levels are extremely high and we need to support each other to keep an environment conducive to learning.
