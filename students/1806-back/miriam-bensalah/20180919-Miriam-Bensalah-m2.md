##Areas of Emphasis

  I wanted to keep up with the pace of the module. Last module, I felt like I was constantly behind and I did not want to experience
  that feeling again in this module. On the whole, I think I met this expectation, though in hindsight I would have liked to
  have a more complete understanding of certain concepts. Additionally, I tried to become very strict with my TDD. I have had 
  a tendency to either start working on something and then going back to create the test or creating the test, but then coding 
  ahead of the error messages. Both of these tendencies have lead to various issues and complications; therefore, I have 
  been trying to break myself of those bad habits early on. Lastly, I am constantly striving to become a better problem solver:
  identifying potential issues and working through them methodically instead of frantically trying out one thing and then the next, 
  not knowing in the end which solutions I have tried and which I have not.

## Blog Post 
 "Classes in Object Oriented Programming - what's the point?"

 I am actually quite happy with how my blog post turned out. It is an explanation that I would like to share with family and
 friends as I tried to make the content as accessible to the average person as possible. I have found that writing is always
 a good way to solidify one's understanding and it was beneficial for me to rethink my own learning process and how I would
 improve how new information was presented to me.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

  I think the Obstacle course could have been helpful if there had been more interaction with ActiveRecord in class. It 
  felt as if all the Active Record learning was saddled on to this one activity and then not discussed again in class. 

## Projects

  My favorite project was the final project. The complexity of it and the team interaction made me feel that we were finally
  doing something "real", using tools like Waffle and GitHub the way we might in a professional environment. For me, that was
  the best part about the project, how relevant it felt. 
  I also liked the Sinatra project, Little Shop. It helped me understand how routes work in a way that Rails masks and it gave
  us an opportunity to work with a framework other than Rails. 
  
  I suppose then by default, I would have to say Job Tracker was my least favorite, though I thought it was very relevant to 
  our learning and I don't have any qualms with the project itself. 
  
  Since I chose to make my own project (vs using an already created project outline), I had to plan out all the project steps 
  and decide what functionality I wanted the project to have and how to implement it. I enjoyed the autonomy of the independent
  project and the challenge of thinking how to implement what we had learned by myself.
  
  In regards to group projects, I have had very positive experiences working with multiple group members and learning
  to navigate different personalities. After comparing/contrasting my experience working on an individual project with working
  on group projects, I discovered that I prefer working with groups as I enjoy the interpersonal interaction rather than 
  considering it an extra challenge to navigate on top of the work itself. In fact, in my final group project, most people had
  3 other group members and I only had 2. This was a clear disadvantage, but I think we all managed to work so well together that
  in the end we were just as effective with 3 people as other groups were with 4.

## Community 

  I revolunteered to be a Student Representative, a role that I really enjoyed because it allowed me to have more interaction
  with my own class as well as with students from other cohorts. 

## Posse
  
  I was not involved with a posse.
