## A: End of Module Assessment

- *"Borderline"*

## B: Individual Work & Projects

1. Foto Finder: final project assessment

### Foto Finder:

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hlhartley/hh-fotofinder-project)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

  1. Number Guesser Doubles: pair project
  2. Ideabox Triples: group project with 3 members

### Number Guesser Doubles:

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hlhartley/number_guesser)
* [Original Assignment - Part 1](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.html)
* [Original Assignment - Part 2](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1810/mod-1/number-guesser/heather-niraj.md)

#### Description
- *Overall: a number guesser game that can be played between 2 players*
- Generates a random number each time the game is started or reset

#### Unique Features
- Various buttons: submit, clear, reset, and clear all cards
- Pops up winner card on the screen when a player wins
- Responsive screen layout for both computer and mobile devices using media queries, flex-box, and display properties
- A min and max range value, which increases and decreases by increments of 10 every time a player guesses the correct answer
- Counts the total number of player guesses and displays on winner card
- Counts and records amount of running game time (based on when submit button is clicked to start game and end game)

#### Evaluation Comments
- Continue to make more commits
- Good descriptive commit messages
- Make sure both sides are making commits
- Continue to make more branches each time you create a new feature
- A few things where elements are spaced unevenly
- Some things misbehaving as screen gets smaller and in mobile view
- Careful of using alerts for errors. Incorporate it in UI like the other errors you did. Cheers!
- Careful of using lots of divs and spans
- Try using more semantic html like H1, p tags, forms, etc
- Nice organization with styles and alphabetizing properties
- Remember to use box-sizing: border-box to elements behave property and respect heights/widths
- Also to clean up code, try grouping classes together or reusing classes
- Clean up commented out lines in Javascript (as well as console.logs)
- Try not to break out global variables into so many sections
- Dry up code when you see repeated lines of code
- Keep functions SRP (single responsibility)
- Keep functions shorter (try and aim for 8 lines max)
- Also, think how you can call fuctions inside of functions more
- Instead of running all functions at the same time (checking range, checking if you need to increase range, checking if the answer is right, etc.), try and run them when they need to be run using if/else conditionals
- For your time, try rounding the numbers using Math.round or Math.floor

#### Evaluation Scores
- Function Expectations: *proficient*: application meets some of the phase two extensions and demonstrates good execution and control of the UI
- Comp Recreation / Design: *advanced beginner*
- HTML: *novice*
- CSS: *advanced beginner*
- JS/jQuery: *advanced beginner*

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
- I made a conscious effort to be active in the Turing community by:
  - Pairing with upper mod students (at least twice a week) and taking their advice and feedback to heart
  - Offering my help to fellow peers (emotional and practical support)
  - Trying to participate often in class and asking questions on unfamiliar concepts
  - Coming in on weekends to practice exercises and contributing equally to group projects with classmates
