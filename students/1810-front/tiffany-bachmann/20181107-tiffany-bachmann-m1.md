**Description**  
The web application is a game where a random number is generated between 1 and 100 and two players can attempt to guess the answer. The players are also able to change the range that the random number is generated between.

**Evaluation Comments:**
* Great job! Really solid first project, loved that y'all added the time tracking functionality.  

_HTML_
* Nice work, maybe be more consistent with class order in that class declaration

_CSS_
* Consider adding organizational comments
* Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes
* Consider using a naming methodology like css BEM

_JS_
* Love that you're using a user class
* Keep things local unless they need to be global
* Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
* Style looked great. Could consider writing the template literal as if its html

**Evaluation scores**  
* Functional Expectations
  * Proficient: Application meets some of the phase two extensions and demonstrates good execution and control of the UI.

#### Ideabox Triples

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Klhalls89/ideaBoxTriples)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

**Description**  
The web application is a page where users can save their ideas, make the quality of their ideas based off a rubic, filter through their ideas based off quality and search through all saved ideas to find ones based off text they input into a search.

**Evaluation Comments:**  
* Good start on more commits.  Make even more smaller commits!
  * Some funny commit messages, but make sure it's super clear on what functionality is being added/fixed.
  * Good start on branches as well, continue to make more branches as you make each commit
* Really love the drop down for the filter by ideas
* Really nice work storing one key with an array into localStorage
* Awesome UI and really great UX.  Very clean and easy to jump into
  * Quality buttons and text aren't quite vertically aligned
* Really nice work making sure things don't break depending on what the user does.  Cheers!
* Nice clean HTML structure
  * Good start on adding some accessibility
  * Some instances where we could use more semantic HTML
    * Like using h1 over p tag, form over section, or label of p tag next to input
    * Good start with adding accessibility to certain parts though including aria-labels
* Nice organization according to page flow with CSS and alphabetizing properties
  * Good use of grouping styles together that share similar properties.  A few other instances that could be grouped, but in general really good work!
* Nice work on your Idea class and using filter when trying to delete elements from localStorage array
  * Might not store the qualityIndex and quality since it gets a bit repetitive.  Store only the qualityIndex
  * Really good work with refactoring your upVote and downVote functionality.  
  * I might not hardcode the beginning and ending of array.  Imagine if you need to add more qualities.
* Really nice organization of main.js separating global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Good use of of array prototype methods over for loops
* Great work refactoring functions and breaking things out into smaller pieces
  * Super clean work with qualityFilter functionality and using the value from event.target
  * Think about how you could refactor the hiding and displaying functionality since that is done both in the Search and the qualityFilter function
