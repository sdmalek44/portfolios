# Eric Weissman M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to fully immerse myself in the content and work on building stamina with struggling and searching for answers on my own. I also wanted to prioritize pairing with others so I could find other avenues/perspectives to learn the content.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSED


## B: Individual Work & Projects
We had two major individual projects - Foto Finder and Static Comp 2.


#### Foto Finder

* [Foto Finder](https://github.com/ericweissman/ew-foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

Build a web-based application that allows user to add, edit, delete, search and favorite multiple images.


#### Static Comp 2

* [Static Comp 2](https://github.com/ericweissman/ew-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Recreate a complex website design using HTML and CSS.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Idea Box & Number Guesser
We had two pair projects that involved creating web-based applications. Utilized driver-navigator process to get experience with communcating ideas/instructions and writing code with correct syntax.

#### Idea Box

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/ericweissman/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

Pair project involved creating web-based application that allows users to generate idea cards and save to local storage. Additional functionality includes giving user ability to edit ideas, search for ideas, and filter by quality. 

##### Student: Travis and Eric
##### Evaluator: David Whitaker
##### Notes/What To Work On:
html
Use forms!
Consider adding js- before classNames that are only used in js
css
rocked it
js
Loved the process
Consider refactoring all of the various calls to local storage to be one call that stores all ideas in an array
Consider refactoring quality data model to be integer based - only worry about the text when we display it.
##### Functional Expectations
Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec
##### Comp Recreation
Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment, etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward
##### HTML - Style and Implementation
Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using data-* attributes for all data related things
##### CSS - Style and Implementation
Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
##### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:


#### Number Guesser

* [Number Guesser](https://github.com/ericweissman/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.html)

Pair project involved creating a web-based application/game where two users take turns guessing a random number that is generated through user inputs. 

##### Student: David and Eric
##### Evaluator: David Whitaker
##### Notes/What To Work On:
HTML
Be sure to use forms for inputs and associated buttons
CSS
Consider adding organizational comments
Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes
Look for duplication as you build
JS
Write with good style on the fly
Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
##### Functional Expectations
Novice: Application meets most of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished.
Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished but shows attention to detail.
##### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
Proficient
##### HTML

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I had prior experience with a program that was very similar to Turing and I knew the level of stress, time commitment, etc. required to be successful. I tried to be a resource for everyone in my module on how to manage time, deal with stress, and perservere when you are feeling lost. I tried to be a positive influence in the classroom and keep everyone in a growth mindset. I also tried to attend as many functions with my classmates outside of Turing. Moreover, I attended the majority of Friday morning speakers to connect more with the community.
