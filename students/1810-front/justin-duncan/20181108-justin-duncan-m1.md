## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual work was very interesting. The static comps, once finished gave me a great sense of accomplishment in that I can produce websites that look good. I enjoyed Foto-Finder the most. Having to figure out how to store a string that is 10s of thousand of characters long into localStorage and be able to reference it was an amazing feeling, once it worked. Also, playing around with a closure coupled with arrays so that I could pass around data that is mutable was an amazing feeling. If I didn't come to turing I would not have tried this.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I was hesitant going into group projects. I have never worked in software dev where my skill was higher than anyone's in the group. I have always been the lower skilled person asking for help. I appreciate this opportunity in that I was shown things that I need to work on when i was presented with such a dynamic during group project 2. Indeed, during my grouping I was much better prepared to interact with the group with lessons learned from group project 1. Specifically, I learned to take a backseat and let others navigate. I learned I can course correct if necessary, but don't give answers as other may not know how I came to such a conclusion. This had a detrimental effect during my first grouping as we had solutions that not everyone was comfortable explaining.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustinD85/number_guesser_doubles)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

Build a game where a user can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the abilty for the use r to add custom ranges for increased difficulty. The second week introduces a two player version.

* Nice work with creating clearer commits 
  * Continue to work on creating more commits
  * Create more branches each time you're working on a new feature 
  * DON'T PUSH UP TO MASTER!
* Nice work pairing up and collaboration.  Playing off each other's strengths.
* Might give some notification that a new game has started after winning.
* Nice error handling and handling multiple user inputs.
* Continue to work on spacing both in desktop and mobile views
  * Buttons get a bit squished
  * Title could be down a bit and centered vertically
  * Center inputs in mobile view
* Might use reset.css or normalize.css for next project for cross browser compatibility
* Careful of using too many div tags (try using more semantic HTML)
  * Use p or button tags instead of divs
* Careful of using camelCase on classes
* I would stick with only forms, inputs, and buttons having IDs
* Continue to work on formatting of HTML and style things according to the styleguide.
* Continue to work on structure of styles and alphabetizing properties
* Be careful of using vh and stick more with pixels or percentages(practice squishing window vertically)
* Clean up commented out lines of code
* Make sure styles follow CSS styleguide (tabbed in correctly)
* When you start to use more classes, hopefully you won't need to use so many styles for ids.  Reuse classes when elements share multiple styles
* Continue to clear up commented out lines in Javascript
* Don't need the window.onload for the global variables and class
* Clear up console.logs as well
* Grab elements in variables instead of returning them in functions.
  * Grab value in event listeners.
* Be consistent using function declarations in event listeners
* To give HTML inputs a default disabled state, add it to the HTML instead of the Javascript
* Nice work with some functions having SRP focus
  * Continue to work on this

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was always available to help and constantly asked and assisted others. I went to Brother's every Thursday which played a great role in getting to know people from other cohorts.
