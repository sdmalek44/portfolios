# Tim Miller - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals when we started MOD1 was to build a solid grasp of the fundementals of html, css and javsscript. it turned into survival and perserverence. I just wanted to make it to the end in one piece, and my leg is barely hanging on.

### Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://timmiller601.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. Every time the user wins a round increase the maximum number by 10 and decreased the minimum number by 10.

#### evaluation comments
use forms in HTML
err on the side of using classes over ids
pull media queries to bottom of page rather than after each individual rule -- current structure would be hard to maintain
refactor winnerBox function
UI needs polish, broken on mobile/small screens
make sure both partners have access and ability to push to the github repo, and if not get help to get the problem resolved
do not slack code to each other

##### Evaluation comments
HTML
Forms should only be inputs with their associated buttons
CSS
Good style and structure
Leverage percentage widths over grid for less complex layouts
JS
Consider where you can leverage parameters and arguments
If there is no else, how could you leverage an else
Grab the whole object from storage. Not individuals properties at once

##### Evaluation scores
Functional Expectations
Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec
Comp Recreation
Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment, etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes.

HTML - Style and Implementation
Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions
CSS - Style and Implementation
Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During Mod1 I wanted to connect with my classmates and help them when and where I could. I wanted to be apart of all of the friday morning talks and engage with mod2 and mod3 students when possible to build a support network. I found 3 or 4 students in each mod that I built a relationship with and leaned on them when I had questions. My next goal is to join a posse and when Alex in mod3 brought up bring back the pahlka posse I jumped at the chance. being involved in non-profit and goverment tech is hopefully where I head when I leave turing. over my next two mods I want to continue to engage and give support to those that need a hand. Lastly, I made a connection that I never thought I would make.
