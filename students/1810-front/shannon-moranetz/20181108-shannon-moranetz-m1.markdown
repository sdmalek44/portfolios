# Shannon Moranetz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had set out to learn object-oriented programming, basic styling and design principles. I believe I have accomplished that goal and feel confident especially in my abilities with Javascript and object-oriented code interactions.

### Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/foxwellm/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

Number Guesser was a paired project which was also my first introduction to Javascript and DOM manipulation. It was a simple game where two users compete to guess a number between the set bounds. 

Use forms for inputs that are tied to buttons
Utilize more block elements and have flex containers be more specific
Consider adding organizational comments
Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes
Always air on the side of being more verbose for naming conventions.
Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
Think in terms of single responsibilty principle (SRP) - Try keeping functions to 10 lines or less and invoke other functions within functions more.

#### IdeaBox Triples

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/ideabox-triples)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

Ideabox was a group project that used object-oriented principles to interact with an idea class when generating or editing ideas. It also was an introduction to localstorage and persistent content within pages.

Forms should only be inputs with their associated buttons
Good style and structure
Leverage percentage widths over grid for less complex layouts
Consider where you can leverage parameters and arguments
If there is no else, how could you leverage an else
Grab the whole object from storage. Not individuals properties at once

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I considered myself an active part of the community this mod. I had frequently stayed late into the night, adjusted my hours accordingly for group projects, came in most weekends. I did my best to help those that were struggling with Javascript, and seeked help from others mostly in regard to my CSS. I was also a part of the QueerQoders posse and attended their meetings both during and after school hours. I made an effort to meet and interact with students from upper mods regularly, and I believe it has made a positive impact on the community as a whole.
