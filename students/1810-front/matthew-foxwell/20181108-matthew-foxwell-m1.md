# Matthew Foxwell - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Early on it was emphasized that mod 1 builds the foundation to success at Turing. Both the teachers along with students who had repeated and were currently in mod 2 greatly promoted having a good solid foundation of mod 1 concepts in order to effectively move on to mod 2. Because of that, my main emphasis was in trying to make sure I understood all the concepts taught to us in mod 1.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed: I believe I did well, although it was brought up that I did not do a good job in speaking out loud that I was thinking about the problem as apposed to just being stuck. My troubleshooting was good, as I had a good use of console.log() whenever I was unsure about what variables I was pulling in. I was fairly confident though in what I was doing and never felt stuck, only that I needed a little time to process what I was looking at.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had 4 individual projects, Dog Party, Static 1, Static 2, and Foto Finder. The first 3 were meant to take us through the evolution of CSS. Dog Pary (Not using Flex or Grid), Static 1 (Not using Grid), Static 2 (Able to use both Grid and Flex). While Foto Finder was meant to make sure we understood as an individual our previous group project.

#### (Dog Party)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/foxwellm/Dog-Party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/dog-party.html)

Recreate static composition without using Flex or Grid

#### (Static 1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/foxwellm/mwf-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Recreate static composition without using Grid

#### (Static 2)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/foxwellm/mwf-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Recreate static composition using all available resources in CSS.

#### (Foto Finder)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/foxwellm/foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

Recreate static composition of application and all functionality. The project was designed to establish a fundamental understanding of how things are stored in local storage. The application took in 3 inputs, a title, caption, and image. The goal was to store the information in local storage and then display the now made cards on page refresh and also if the user selects them by favorites.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our 2 group projects were Number Guesser (2 person project) and IdeaBox (3 person project), the projects were meant for us to start learning how to work as a team to accomplish a project. 

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/foxwellm/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

Recreate static composition of application and all functionality. The project was designed to teach us about Javascript logic and how to manipulate varibles within. The application was a game for two players to try to guess what random number the game had stored within a certain limit of a minimum and maximum value.

#### HTML
Use forms for inputs that are tied to buttons
Utilize more block elements and have flex containers be more specific

#### CSS
Consider adding organizational comments
Try using more broad class declarations in place of comma separated classes

#### JS
Always air on the side of being more verbose for naming conventions.
Consider using parameters and arguments if you identify duplicate statements to dry things up.
Think in terms of single responsibilty principle (SRP) - Try keeping functions to 10 lines or less and invoke other functions within functions more.

Evaluation Scrores : Advanced Beginner - Proficient in all areas.

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hlhartley/ideabox-triples)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

Recreate static composition of application and all functionality. The application stored a title and "idea" to local storage and then could display them as cards in order of last made. Extra functions were that they could be filtered by user ranking or that the user could search through them by a string input.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I attended almost all the talks held in the mornings before school started at 8:00 AM. Showing support for them shows that we appreciate the people coming to talk to us and helps us as a community have more speakers come to Turing.
