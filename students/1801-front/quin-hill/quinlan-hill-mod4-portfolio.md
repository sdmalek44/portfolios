# Quin's Module 4 Portfolio Presentation

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
- My biggest Achievement in mod4 was my capstone project. We had a group of 4 people, 2 each for back end and front end. The RTD-Mobile-App addresses a real world issue in making giving users a more intuitive RTD application to find public transit schedules and connections.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
- The amount of time we had to receive each project was the greatest struggle. I felt under constant pressure to work more and couldn't sleep well at times, because of it.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
- I started a group called refreshVanillaJS to help people in mods 3 and 4 get back to the basics, focusing on dom-manipulation and using mod2 concepts for mod1 projects.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
- I'm not sure it impacted what I want to do after Turing, but it gave me a much better understanding of how APIs are stuctured, how to set them up, and how to interact with them.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
- coding in JavaScript and workflow, mainly, but also the confidence that I can achieve a lot more than I previously thought possible.
